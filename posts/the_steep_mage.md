### Introduction

Fog chokes Veshra Cemetery. Monuments lean at drunken angles and a half-collapsed chapel marks the cemetery's northern edge. At its center, three excavated graves form a triangle around Lady Veshra's monument.

A robed figure sits on a stool near the monument, porcelain tea service arranged _just so_ on a headstone. **The Steep Mage** sips from fine bone china while his gravediggers work, their spades biting into consecrated earth.

The cemetery's Sentinel Crows have betrayed him. He will have company this night. **The Burning Faith** come to purge the site. **Veshra descendants** are here for their inheritance. And breaking the seal on Lady Veshra's coffin releases the **Grief Wraiths**, who do not discriminate.

### Factions

**The Steep Mage:** (`Grave Rituals, Cursed in Verse, Wife's Tea Set`). Soft-spoken, exhausted and trapped in perpetual rhyme. He mumbles under his breath, sipping tea with dramatic pauses.
- **Grett:** (`His Loyal Fool, Strong Back`). Lead digger who thinks the Steep Mage is misunderstood.

**The Burning Faith** Fanatics who aim to destroy the Soulstone and salt the graveyard. They use ambush, salt circles, burning sage. They won't negotiate with "those who traffic with the dead." They watch from the chapel ruins, drawing salt circles and arguing about when to strike. Their torches are visible and smell of burning sage.
- **Sister Mara:** (`The Silver Mask, Unclean Purifier, Pragmatic`)
- **Brother Tove:** (`Young Blood, Tracker of the Damned, There Are No Absolutes`)

**Veshra's Descendants** believe the Soulstone is family property and their last, best asset. They use stealth, bribery, appeals to law—including promises of payment to mercenaries they can't afford. They won't destroy grandmother's remains or let the stone burn.
- **Vira Veshra:** (`Last of Her Line, Exiled Noble, Desperate`)
- **Sellswords**: (`Hired Muscle, Professional`). They're waiting at the cemetery gate, sharpening blades, sharing a flask. One keeps asking _"Where is she?"_ Another: _"We should just take whatever's valuable and go."_

### The Twist

Breaking the seal on Veshra's coffin releases the **Grief Wraiths** (`Guardians of the Stone, Sorrowful Touch, Lingering Cold`)

### The Curse in Verse
The Steep Mage suffers a binding curse delivered beside his wife’s murder. If he fails to speak in rhyme, his lungs collapse. Tea and short breaths keep him alive between verses. He believes the Soulstone can free him—and bring her back. Without it he is surely doomed.

> Your victim must communicate<br>
> constantly in verse<br>
> for if they fail to rhyme their words<br>
> their lungs are going to burst<br>
> small amounts of food and drink<br>
> might quickly be consumed<br>
> but should they falter or take sleep<br>
> their lives are surely doomed.
