### Introduction

Fog chokes Veshra Cemetery. Monuments lean at drunken angles and a half-collapsed chapel marks the cemetery's northern edge. At its center, three excavated graves form a triangle around Lady Veshra's monument.

A robed figure sits on a stool near the monument, porcelain tea service arranged _just so_ on a headstone. **The Steep Mage** sips from fine bone china while his gravediggers work, their spades biting into consecrated earth.

He will have company this night. **The Burning Faith** come to purge the site. **Veshra descendants** are here for their inheritance. And breaking the seal on Lady Veshra's coffin releases the **Grief Wraiths**, who do not discriminate.

### Factions

**The Steep Mage:** (`Grave Rituals, Speaks To Dead, Wife's Tea Set`). Soft-spoken, exhausted. Believes the Soulstone can bring his wife back permanently this time.
- **Grett:** (`The Loyal Fool, Strong Back`). Lead digger who thinks the Steep Mage is just misunderstood.

**The Burning Faith** aim to destroy the Soulstone and salt the graveyard. They use ambush, salt circles, burning sage. They won't negotiate with "those who traffic with the dead."
- **Sister Mara:** (`The Silver Mask, Unclean Purifier, Pragmatic`)
- **Brother Tove:** (`Young Blood, Tracker of the Damned, There Are No Absolutes`)

**Veshra's Descendants** believe the Soulstone is family property and their last, best asset. They use stealth, bribery, appeals to law—including promises of payment to mercenaries they can't afford. They won't destroy grandmother's remains or let the stone burn.
- **Vira Veshra:** (`Last of Her Line, Exiled Noble, Desperate`)

### The Twist

Breaking the seal on Veshra's coffin releases the **Grief Wraiths** (`Guardians of the Stone, Sorrowful Touch, Lingering Cold`)

### Tables

#### 2d6 Grave Findings
| 2d6 | Discovery |
|-----|-----------|
| 2 | **Paupers' Pit**: Mass grave. Disturbing it summons Grief Wraiths immediately |
| 3 | **Chapel Bell**: The tower's bell has no clapper but rings when the wraiths stir |
| 4 | **Child's Garden**: Small grave, stone rabbits, fresh flowers. Disturbing it draws phantom crying that alerts anyone nearby |
| 5 | **Hunter's Camp**: Fresh salt circle, still-warm coals, tracks heading toward monument. Blessed silver stakes (30s) |
| 6 | **Merchant's Monument**: Lead coffin with solid silver burial mask (200s) |
| 7 | Vira's forged deed claiming cemetery as family property |
| 8 | **Witch's Cairn**: Stones in iron chains, warm. Rare herbs and attuned rune-bones inside |
| 9 | **Collapsed Mausoleum**: Cracked stone reveals passage beneath cemetery to the chapel |
| 10 | **Knight's Grave**: Full plate armor and longsword (800s) |
| 11 | **Lovers' Tomb**: Ornate silver locket (40 silver) and matching rings (20 silver)
| 12 | **Gambler's Grave**: Monument etched with playing cards and the phrase "Don't play poker with jokers." Pressing the joker relief opens compartment with loaded dice, marked cards, and 200 silver |

#### d6 Complications
1. Fog rolls in heavy—sound travels but sight doesn't
2. Digger panics, flees screaming about "cold hands under the earth"
3. Grief Wraith attacks whoever touched the Soulstone last
4. Sister Mara arrives openly, drawing salt circles, demanding surrender
5. A scream cuts through the fog; then silence. Something's gone very wrong
6. Sentinel Crows alert everyone to your location
