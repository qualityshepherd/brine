I like to weave pre-written modules into my campaigns (parts of them, anyway). The different tones and ideas keep my players guessing and oftentimes end up becoming part of our lore. Case in point: when I threw [Prison of the Hated Pretender](http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2012/08/prison-of-hated-pretender-pdf.html) into my longrunning campaign. I had previously run it as a one-shot when one of my players was unavailable. It ended in a TPK ðŸ™„.

<break>

Being the benevolent GM that I am, I decided to bring my campaign party back to this setting and witness their one-shot character's dead, broken bodies. They also found out that the Pretender... HAS ESCAPED! In search of his crown, he immediately sought out... _Black Jenny_.

**The Hated Pretender and Black Jenny are now NPCs in my world.** From the module, we know Jenny's name; the name of her gang, and that she stole the crown of the Hated Pretender. Thus, I had to flesh her out a bit. This is what I came up with...

### The Gang

Jenny's "sons" are neither boys nor related to her by blood. Street urchins with promise; she recruits them, trains them and puts them to work. All mentions of her _Miscreant Sons_ are met with a collective groan from the girls. It is safer to pose as _sons than daughters_; so they look the other way... _but hate it_.

  - **Black Jenny** - _road agent_
    > `hd5(+2con); ac+2; at2d6(+2dex/0str): 2d6(+1 daggers)`

    > She has dark hair and black leather armor. A string of onyx gemstones around her neck. She wants to retire... in a _black tower_.

  - **Natty** - _thief_
    > `hd3; ac0; at1d6(+2dex/0str): 1d6(bow +1/daggers); lock picks/backstab;`

    > The oldest of the girls at 14, it's getting more and more difficult to play the role of a "son". She wears her long, red hair in a _boys style_; frumpy clothes and is quick to pick a pocket.

  - **Lunara** - _alchemist_
    > `hd3; ac0; at1d6: 1d6(+1 pistols/darts); ritual/lore`

    > She sports a blonde bowl cut and a tunic with multiple burn marks. Through rituals, she is able to concoct healing potions, gunpowder and an _exploding_ paralysis potion. She wears a leather satchel full of glass vials.

  - **Peregrine** - _ranger_
    > `hd3(+2con); ac0; at1d6(+1str): bite/claws;`

    > She is a _skin-walker_ and can shapeshift into a falcon. She has a number of tattoos and spiked, dark hair. She always attacks in falcon form.

### Tactics

The gang will attempt to get an edge by having **Peregrine** drop a paralysis vial on targets. Those that remain moving will get the same potion via a dart from **Lunara**. Otherwise, they will turn to **Natty's** stealth or ability to _obtain_ things...
