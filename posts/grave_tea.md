### MOURNING RITUAL

A single session graveyard séance. Inspired by gothic horror, your neighbor's extravagant Halloween decorations, and campfire ghost stories.

### SETUP

Roll or choose to see **Who You Are**, and then collaboratively make up suitable characters.

The cemetery is old, neglected, with monuments at drunken angles. A half-collapsed chapel marks the northern edge. At the center, three fresh excavations form a triangle around Lady Veshra's monument.

### WAKING

You wake in Veshra Cemetery as fog rolls in. Your memory cuts off at sunset. The taste of tea lingers on your tongue.

Near Lady Veshra's monument, a robed figure sits on a stool, pouring from fine bone china. Steam rises from the cup. Fresh earth surrounds three excavated graves arranged in a triangle.

**The Steep Mage:** (`Grave Rituals, Speaks To Dead, Wife's Tea Set`). Soft-spoken, exhausted. Believes the Soulstone can bring his wife back permanently this time.

The figure pauses mid-pour. He's noticed you. Or perhaps he's been waiting.

**Sentinel Crows** settle on the chapel's broken tower, watching.

### POTENTIAL WORLD DETAILS

**Who You Are:**

1. Last of the Veshra line, here for your inheritance
2. Purifier of the Burning Faith, hunting the Steep Mage
3. Grave robber who picked the wrong cemetery
4. Wraith-touched, drawn here by months of dreams
5. Mercenary hired by someone who never arrived
6. The dead woman he's trying to resurrect

**What's in the Monument?:**

1. The Soulstone pulses with captured grief
2. Lady Veshra's silver burial mask (worth 200s)
3. A marriage contract binding the Steep Mage eternally
4. Veshra family ledger showing massive debts
5. Three sealed letters, one addressed to you
6. Nothing. The coffin was opened years ago

**In the Chapel:**

1. Bell tower with no clapper—but it rings when wraiths stir
2. Fresh salt circle, warm coals, blessed silver stakes
3. Child's garden with stone rabbits and fresh flowers
4. Collapsed floor revealing passages beneath cemetery
5. Altar with tea service identical to the one outside
6. Your own name carved into the confessional

**Grave Disturbance:**

1. Cold hands grab from below—a Grief Wraith emerges
2. Phantom crying alerts everyone in the cemetery
3. You find a silver locket worth 40s and matching rings
4. Knight's full plate armor and longsword (worth 800s)
5. Mass grave—disturbing it summons all the wraiths at once
6. Nothing but bones and the smell of tea

**Who Else Arrives?:**

1. **Sister Mara** in silver mask, drawing salt circles
2. **Vira Veshra** with forged deed and desperate eyes
3. **Brother Tove** tracking blessed footprints through fog
4. **Grett** the digger, loyal and simple, defending his master
5. More wraiths, drawn by the disturbance
6. No one. You're alone with the Steep Mage

**Random Complication:**

1. Fog rolls in heavy—sound travels but sight doesn't
2. A digger screams about "cold hands" and flees
3. Someone touched the Soulstone—wraiths hunt them
4. A scream cuts through fog, then silence
5. The Steep Mage offers you tea and answers
6. Crows scatter, alerting everyone to your location

### THE CHARACTERS MIGHT

- **Accept the tea** and negotiate with the Steep Mage about his resurrection ritual
- **Stop the ritual** by destroying the Soulstone or sealing the graves
- **Claim the inheritance** by proving Veshra lineage or forging documents
- **Escape** before wraiths, purifiers, or something worse arrives
- **Remember** why their memory ends at sunset and what that means
- **Make a deal** with Lady Veshra's spirit, the wraiths, or the Steep Mage

### TWIST

Breaking the seal on Veshra's coffin releases the **Grief Wraiths** (`Guardians of the Stone, Sorrowful Touch, Lingering Cold`). They hunt anyone who disturbs the graves, regardless of intention.
