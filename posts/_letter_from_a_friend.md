### Introduction

At midday a baker's apprentice walks across the square, flour-dusted and vacant-eyed. Delivers a letter to your table without speaking. Before you can question him he's three streets away holding bread he doesn't remember baking. The letter details a secret chamber beneath the magistrate's study. Gold enough for lifetimes. A ledger proving crimes. A key around his neck. Instructions: leave the ledger on the town hall steps, keep the gold. Justice and fortune for those with courage to act. Signed: A Friend.

Prior Mother Cass checks the road constantly, asking every rider about news from the capital. She's waiting for something called the Shard of St. Gemina's Mirror. The ritual circle is already drawn in her private chapel. The locked chest sits ready. She just needs the relic to complete what she started three years ago when they burned a woman for witchcraft.

**Layout:** Magistrate's white stone mansion northwest of square, second floor study overlooks everything. Town hall faces it across cobblestones. Riverside convent sits east, Prior Mother's domain. Guard barracks adjacent to mansion. Execution site dead center where six streets meet. Old mill on town edge where children gather at night. Every morning someone scrubs scorch marks in the center of the square where six roads meet. The marks never fade. Fresh flowers appear over the stains each week. They die within hours, brown and withered.

### Who Are You?

* Hired by Prior Mother Cass for unspecified spiritual work - good pay, minimal details
* Tracking someone who disappeared in Millhaven months ago - the letters stopped abruptly  
* Hired by desperate parents who claim their child has been corrupted by something in this town
* Caught here by storm or circumstance when someone pressed the letter into your hand

### Factions

**PRIOR MOTHER CASS**

* Wants: Her twin sister destroyed permanently, the Shard to arrive before the children act, her control maintained, the Thornhaven conspiracy buried forever
* Methods: Confession as intelligence gathering, spiritual authority, guilt as currency, stalling tactics until the weapon arrives
* Won't: Admit she orchestrated her sister's execution, confess to anyone, complete the exorcism without the Shard (too dangerous), acknowledge she and Elira use identical control methods
* Key NPC: **Prior Mother Cass** (`Faith, Knife, Silence`) hears every confession, keeps her own ledger of sins, never kneels to anyone. Checks the road obsessively. Her hands shake when she blesses protective charms for frightened parents.

**THE DYBBUK'S MISSION**

* Wants: The ledger published, Vex ruined specifically, the children capable of surviving without her, then to move on and be done
* Methods: Possession through ash and bone, organizing via the Children's Council, leveraging secrets gleaned from overheard confessions, building dependency while claiming to teach independence
* Won't: Harm those who defended her, hurt children directly, admit she's weaponizing them, recognize she's becoming her sister, stop before Vex suffers for taking her place
* Key NPC: **Elira the Burned** (`Smoke, Ember, Echo`) possesses through anything that touched her pyre. Started with three children. Now there are dozens. Plans to leave them when her mission completes. Doesn't realize how hard that will be.

**THE CHILDREN'S COUNCIL**

* Wants: Build the world Elira showed them, prove themselves worthy of her trust, punish the guilty, protect each other, make smoke-mother proud enough to stay
* Methods: Recruitment through games and stories, surveillance networks parents don't see, coordinated action planned for three days from now, social pressure, ever-expanding lists
* Won't: Betray each other, accept adult authority contradicting Elira's teachings, wait for permission, admit their justice lists have become purge lists
* Key NPCs: **Mari Kess** (`Spark, Stone, Truth`), age 12, first convert, leads council meetings at old mill, practices her "reading voice" for public accusations. **Little Jory Moss** (`Shadow, Thorn, Watch`), age 8, innkeeper's son, recruits through casual conversation, knows things he shouldn't. **The Twins Beck** (`Mirror, Smoke, Whisper`), age 10, can be possessed simultaneously, translate Elira's complex instructions, their drawings show detailed execution methods.
* Structure: Inner circle possessed and remember it. Outer circle converted through peer pressure and belief. New recruits being tested. They meet nightly, practice formations, keep lists that grow longer every day.

**THE PUPPET MAGISTRATE**

* Wants: To believe his orders are his own ideas, to keep the stolen gold, to earn salvation through increased devotion, to not remember she died in his place
* Methods: Public authority, legal mechanisms, confession twice weekly with doubled offerings, reading unsigned letters he tells himself he wrote
* Won't: Remove the key even to sleep, question where his morning instructions come from, admit what really happened three years ago, look directly at what he's become
* Key NPC: **Magistrate Cornelius Vex** (`Thorn, Iron, Ash`) touches the key constantly, checks locks obsessively, his hands shake when unlocking anything. Had the key blessed for protection. Genuinely believes the lies he tells himself.

### The Twist

Elira and Cass are twins. Ten years ago, the rival town upriver, Thornhaven, was thriving. Then came the accidents: mill fire, bridge collapse, crop blight, coordinated bandit raids. All orchestrated by Cass through paid intermediaries. Refugees fled to Millhaven. Their property was seized through "legal" mechanisms. Trade routes redirected. Everyone in Millhaven prospered from Thornhaven's orchestrated destruction.

Elira discovered the proof. Payment records. Letters in Cass's handwriting. Instructions to the bandits. She ran to the magistrate's house screaming about murder and conspiracy. They took her the next morning. Vex was supposed to burn for smaller crimes, but Cass needed a scapegoat fast. She convinced the town Elira was possessed, dangerous, corrupting the community. They burned her sister to protect the prosperity they'd all benefited from.

The Shard of St. Gemina's Mirror is a fragment of an ancient relic. St. Gemina and her twin Secundina were both accused of possession. The church used the full mirror to determine truth. One reflection showed corruption, one purity. Gemina was executed. Secundina was canonized. History doesn't record which was which. The shards trap spirits permanently. Cass will use it to force Elira to see her own reflection, what she's become, then shatter the mirror and bury the pieces with Elira's fractured image trapped across them forever.

The ledger has four sections. First: Vex's local crimes in his cramped, justified script. Second: the town's complicity in Elira's burning, names and dates. Third: Elira's reorganization plan, detailed and ruthless and arguably better than what exists. Fourth, only visible when held in ash from the execution ground: Elira's confession about what she's doing to the children, the truth she can't face while conscious but writes while possessing others.

The children don't know smoke-mother had a twin. Don't know Prior Mother orchestrated the burning. Don't know they're weapons in a family war. Don't know their justice lists have become something darker. Don't know she's planning to leave them when this ends.

### Locations

* **The Secret Chamber:** Ten feet below Vex's study, bookcase passage triggered by moving specific volumes. No windows, no exits. Gold stacked in neat rows stolen over years. The four-section ledger on a reading stand like scripture. Hidden beneath: payment records to Thornhaven bandits, letters in Cass's handwriting, proof of the conspiracy.
* **The Execution Ground:** Six roads meet. Scorch marks form a rough circle, never fade despite daily scrubbing. Air tastes of smoke at night. Elira's bones buried underneath with her shawl, herbs, wedding ring. Children leave offerings: flowers, stones, drawings of what they'll do when the day comes.
* **The Old Mill:** Abandoned, town edge. Council meets here nightly. Walls covered in chalk lists: guilty, clean, undecided. Plans sketched in child handwriting. Punishment methods drawn with disturbing detail. The lists grow longer every meeting.
* **Prior Mother's Chapel:** Private, locked, inside the convent. Ritual circle drawn in silver and salt. Locked chest waiting for the Shard. Protective charms stacked by the door for frightened parents. Her personal confession ledger hidden behind a loose stone, never shown to anyone.
* **Town Hall Steps:** Wide marble, visible from a dozen windows. Guards patrol past every twenty minutes. Where the ledger must go public. Where the children plan to stand in formation and read accusations. Where everything will be exposed or buried.
* **The Schoolhouse:** Normal during day. At night, possessed teachers give special lessons to inner circle: town maps, organizational theory, practice speeches, revolutionary logistics a ten-year-old can understand.

### 2d6 Complications

2. A child approaches, whispers "Smoke-mother says you're sad about your brother, the one who drowned," walks away
3. Parents corner the PCs privately, beg for help deprogramming their kids or beg the PCs to leave before being added to lists
4. Mari Kess offers alliance directly: PCs get the gold, children place the ledger, everyone benefits
5. Prior Mother pulls PCs aside, confesses Elira is her twin, begs them to help complete the exorcism before "she corrupts more innocents"
6. The Twins Beck manifest Elira simultaneously, she negotiates calmly: help us or leave, but decide fast
7. Vex breaks during confession with Prior Mother, the PCs overhear him trying to confess everything, unable to finish
8. The children stage a midnight practice run with perfect coordination, adults somehow sleep through everything
9. Possessed teacher gives lesson on revolutionary organization while PCs hide in schoolhouse, hear the complete plan
10. The Shard arrives early, Cass begins immediate preparations, children mobilize to stop her, timeline accelerates dangerously
11. Chamber floor conceals deeper vault: documentation of the Thornhaven conspiracy, more stolen property, evidence of the refugees' "legal" dispossession
12. Both plans trigger simultaneously: exorcism at execution ground as children march in formation to read the ledger publicly, town tears itself apart choosing sides

### d6 What's In The Chamber

1. Three lifetimes of gold from multiple sources, far more than one magistrate could steal alone
2. The four-section ledger, fourth section only visible with ash from the execution ground
3. Payment records for Thornhaven bandits, letters in Cass's handwriting, complete proof of the ten-year conspiracy
4. Collection of deeds and property seizures from Thornhaven refugees, "legal" theft documented in perfect order
5. Their mother's prayer book with binding rituals for blood relatives, proof the twins were born to this, a third binding ritual left incomplete
6. Elira's burned shawl in oilcloth, her strongest anchor to this world, touching it risks immediate possession

### d6 What The Children Sing

1. "Thirty-seven watched and didn't speak, thirty-seven names we keep, when the day comes we'll make them weep"
2. "The council meets when parents sleep, promises made are promises we keep"
3. "Little eyes see, little ears hear, we know who's guilty, we know who's clear"
4. "Smoke-mother teaches, smoke-mother knows, smoke-mother remembers everyone who chose"
5. "They think we're children playing games, but we remember all their names"
6. "The mirror tried to show the truth, but couldn't tell which twin was proof"
