 ## Nekros Manteia

Like most Necromancers, Indis Fane came to the craft by happenstance. Or at least, she imagines this to be the case. Her teacher did hint that he too fell upon the path; changing the subject to all follow up questions. Practitioners, understandably, are not chatty folk. They tend to mimic their subjects in this way. Might she be the last? Her heart is neither coal nor gold. She deals in death because it is within her power. Like any gifted person might, she takes pride in perfecting her skill. She catches herself adding flourishes in her movements; theatrics without audience. _Why do I do that?_

Indis hales from Duskby. She is the reason for the poor harvest. She required the life force of a copse of white oak... she underestimated the reach of their taproots; the resulting blight was unintended.

An aging wealthy merchant hired Indis to extend his life. Not understanding the dangers that messing with the balance of nature, she thought the trees wouldn't be missed. The blight brought a poor harvest and Duskby is hungry. The people are keen to blame and Indis is definitely on the list. It also called the attention of a dryad who looks for retribution. Meanwhile, the merchant is making shittons of money but importing foods.
