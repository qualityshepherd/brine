_v 1.6_

> The door to magic is closed for most; some few may find it ajar; _fewer still_ may pick the door's lock altogether. Aptitude for the craft is is not unusual but is often misinterpreted. Great magic requires _constant practice_. The best magi are not always the most gifted; just _persistent_.

> **Magic is dangerous**; spells go poorly and the consequences can be... severe.

### Mechanics

**You can master spells equal to your level + 2** (eg. 1st level magi have mastered 3 spells).

Casting spells takes a physical toll. **You can safely cast spells equal to your `hd + con`** (ie. _spell slots_). Above that, you take `1d6+lvl` damage for each spell cast. Safe casting is restored after resting in _comfort and safety_.

**Mages add `int` to their casting rolls; clerics add `wis`** (eg. `2d6+int/wis`) and your `level` to damage rolls (eg. `2d6+lvl`). You gain an extra `d6` of damage at levels 5 & 10.

When you level up, you may swap mastered spells for new ones.


### Scrolls

**You may attempt to cast spells from written texts**. This requires more casting time while you read/review the spell (ie. _a turn_) and expends a _spell slot_.

It is wise to identify a spell before casting it!


### Enhancements

[_Enhancement_ spells](https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=enhancement) are cast in conjunction with a target spell. They augment spell casting and/or effect, and expend a _spell slot_ in addition to the target spell.

### Mishaps

**Magic is dangerous**. A failed casting roll may have consequences; a critical fail always will.

An example mishap table:

  1. the target reflects the spell back at caster
  1. 1d6 damage to the caster
  3. the caster is blinded/frozen/afraid/etc... for a short time
  4. the spell affects the party in some way (depending on the spell)
  5. the caster turns blue
  6. nothing happens... _lucky_


### Addendum

Presented as an alternate/additional magic system for [World of Dungeons](http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf).

I have a [growing list of spells](/#spells) and/or allow players to create their own.
