Kurt Vonnegut is my fav author. I've been re-reading all his books including his workshops on writing. It occurred to me that his advice for creative writing was hilariously inline with rpg writing; which makes sense but still; interesting.

**1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.**

Be concise and obvious in writing. Maybe don't have umpteen pages of lore or walls of text or a "what is a RPG" section or purple prose or run-on sentences. "Have the guts to cut" (another Kurtism). Anything not necessary for running the game gets the axe; be ruthless! Get the reader into the action asap or risk losing them. Kurt's advice seems also to imply: _keep the reader reading_.

**2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.**

As the reader of RPGs is a GM, this is _essential_, and perhaps better stated as: _Give the GM one character they are dying to play_. In a broader sense, give the GM _things_ that make them REALLY want to run your shite for their table.

I just sat here for a minute thinking back and yes, it's usually an NPC that sucks me in. My mind immediately goes to Gus L's [Prison of the Hated Pretender](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/333389/Prison-of-the-Hated-Pretender). I wanted to play the Pretender SO bad!

**3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.**

This is _adventure writing 101_ advice and rock solid. That being said, when I repurposed my old NPC generator into [Rando](https://rando.brine.dev), I ditched the `want` part. The main reason being: I found myself not using the `want`. I'm not totally sure why... :thinking: I suppose, given a random NPC generator, I'm not really looking for `want`? Or at least that's how it played out. In Rando, I went with three epithets ala [Named](https://wightbred.itch.io/named-toolkit) for NPCs; which I love (`@wightbred`, you ruined me for other ways... thus far). But I also use Rando while writing and just add `wants` that make sense with the other moving pieces.

**4. Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.**

In addition to character, I would broaden this to include _setting_ or _world_. Bake setting into EVERY. THING. In fact, don't bake it in... mash it in there till setting oozes out of every word!

This also implies revisioning but of course you DO revise, yes? Honestly, I revise too much. It's a sickness and slows me down SOOOO much. Like Vonnegut, I am a "Basher": _going one sentence at a time, getting it exactly right before they go on to the next one_. It's awful. I envy "Swoopers": _write a story quickly, higgledy-piggledy, crinkum-crankum, any which way. Then they go over it again painstakingly, fixing everything_.

**5. Start as close to the end as possible.**

This is both part of #1, and good game-running advice: _get the PCs in the action asap_. I actually suck at this. I've caught myself having my PCs lollygagging around, walking to a door, relating pointless information along the way. DUMB. This is easy to catch in writing tho; especially when play-testing. Don't start them in the town and bate them to the thing... BOOM, you're at the thing!

**6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.**

I'm guilty of this one too. I mean, I am OUT on adventures that have MONSTER, MONSTER, MONSTER, MONSTER, MONSTER. But I find myself over-correcting sometimes and going a little light on my players. This is also easier to spot in writing/play-testing. To quote Tom Waits: _"There's always some killing you've got to do around the farm"_... so it goes.

**7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.**

I struggle with this one. I don't write for _one person_. Kurt wrote for his sister... to my knowledge I don't write for any specific person. Maybe I do and I don't know it? I def write for _me_. I'm writing this post for me. I'm forcing myself to really think these through; which for my brain means I need to write them down. Obviously, when writing RPGs, we write for GMs, but that GM is _also_ me.

**8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.**

This is more classic RPG advice perhaps most famously from Chris McDowall's post [Expose Your Prep](https://www.bastionland.com/2018/07/expose-your-prep.html). But for all I know, Chris stole it from Vonnegut :D
