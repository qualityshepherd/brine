### The Problem

Community collapses into groupthink when tied to:
1. **Money/product**: Financial incentives demand conformity.
2. **Personality**: Disagreeing with the figurehead feels like betrayal.

In these cases, this is exactly what they want. Groupthink _is_ the desired outcome.

This is why I avoid Discord servers that are essentially products or personalities operating as products. But I've had similar problems with various *acronym movements* where purism became fascism and stabbed the community like so many bioluminescent fungi.

And yet... I yearn for a group. *My* group... hold the groupthink.

### Ball-Stoppers
> Apologies for the basketball reference ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

These are the conversation killers. You throw them "the ball"—a topic, idea, link, whatever—and they respond with absolute authority on the matter, killing any hope of conversation. To extend the metaphor: they catch the pass and proceed to pound the air out of the ball until the game clock expires. Game over.

What makes them deadly is NOT that they're *wrong*; sometimes they're right. It's that they treat every conversational opening as a problem to be solved rather than something to explore together.

**And it's sad how often these ball-stoppers become mods... and the server slowly dies.**

But it's tricky. They're constantly visible because they respond to everything. Their confidence looks like expertise. They're always there because shutting down conversations takes way less energy than having them. And worst of all, their ball-stopping *looks* like keeping the server organized. "This person really gets it!" but they're actually suffocating the community. The engaged, interesting people _quiet-quit_.

### Disease at Scale

Big server means mods. There's only so many peeps that can self-regulate. But **mods are a band-aid for having too many people you don't actually trust.**

### Quality over Quantity

My server has one rule:
1. Don't be an asshole
2. Don't invite people who need more than one rule

Overlooking my shitty math for the moment, these aren't really rules. They're a vibe check. You're here because we get along even when we don't agree. When we get mad, we know how to walk away. Everyone needs a nudge now and then, but with some people _a nudge is NOT as good as a wink... know what I mean?_.

**The real rule: Stay small enough that "asshole" is obvious to everyone, not just a mod.**


### Signal Flares

So how do you find _your_ people?

Create something: a blog post, a tool, art, shitpost—something that appeals to _your_ people. **Your work does the filtering.** The people who respond enthusiastically are pre-filtered. They found you because your signal resonated at their frequency.

**This post, my [games](https://brine.dev/#post?s=of_yarn_and_bone), [podcasts](https://worldof.brine.dev/) and [tools](https://rando.brine.dev/)... these are my signal flares.** If you read this far and you're nodding, we might be people!
