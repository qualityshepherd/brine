### Setup
**Establish The World** at the table; setting, tone, and stakes

### Play Loop
1. **Set the Scene**
   - build from their last choice (they chose to go to the temple)
   - honor or twist their expectations (ghouls attack as expected OR are friendly?)
   - push character buttons (challenge what they care about)
   - describe using multiple senses
2. **WHAT DO YOU DO?**
3. **Rolls** change the situation:
   - **Success = "Yes, but..."** goal + complication
   - **Failure = "No, and..."** fail + escalation
   - **Offer bargains:** "you succeed IF you accept [cost/risk]"
4. **Use NPCs:** to deliver information, offer opportunities, escalate conflict
5. **Fast-forward** through the boring stuff; keep it moving
