description: A magic system that feels _magical_?
---

I'm updating my magic system, including [the original post](https://brine.dev/#post?s=on_magical_magic) that  describes the system narratively (sorry if this annoys). I thought I'd also walk through it a bit in this post...

The goal is a magic system that feels _magical_; no easy task. I took elements from my favorite magic systems: Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell and A Wizard of Earthsea. Magic is like music: some can, some can't; some read, some intuit. Magic is of the world... a mage asks favors of it and/or does favors for it.

- ask a stone to gather its brethren and create a road
- ask the air to withhold itself from a creature until it is unconscious
- ask a still lake to reflect a scene its been witness to
- ask the moon to hold back the tide
- help tell the story of a misdeed that a forest or church or statue cannot alone

**Totems** can also spark a player's creativity for spells for their mage:

- bark from a hanging tree
- a stone from an enemies castle
- any manner of items found in an apothecary
- a king's slipper
- a coin from a beggar's cup

**Burdens** are ballance in the magical world (Earthsea). Representing them with tarot is part GM/Player support and part... well... mysticism? They're an oracle for storytelling, and give consequences a symbolic, narrative hook instead of being just a penalty.

**Promises** are like cantrips. Any mage worth his socks should be able to cast these simple, ephemeral spells. Substantial magic requires **Rituals** that can take days, weeks or even months. And then **Summoning** is the crazy train of opening yourself up to the whims of the Fey. Eg. only they can bring life back to the dead?

I try to provide just enough structure and support, while leaving it open to interpretation and creativity at the table. It certainly won't be for everyone... and perhaps not even _anyone_ but me :D
