### WHO IN THE WORLD ARE YOU?

Your character is a product of the world—they start with three `Names` that describe their place in it. `Names` are epithets that might be a role they fill, an identity or something whispered about them. They are actionable, used in play, and may change or be awarded (up to six total).

1. Create three `Names` that define your character; here are some prompts to help:

- What role does your character have in the world? eg. Reluctant Captain, Aging Herbalist, Corrupt Spy
- Anything from their past? eg. Orphaned Princess, Butcher's Boy, Bee Queen
- What trait describes them? eg. Arrogant, Devoted, Flamboyant
- Do they have a strong relationship? eg. Husband, Mother, Lover
- Are they known for something? eg. Scholar, Duelist, Fighter, From Planet Xerf
- Do they own something of note? eg. The Good Ship Revenge, A Xerfian Protoblaster, Pet Falcon
- Do they have a strong belief? eg. For Queen and Country, Anarchy!, The Way of the Snail

2. Write down three words that describe your character's look, features or vibe.
3. Name your character

Your character has typical gear based on their `Names`. Consider making any extravagant gear a `Name`.

#### Legendary Names

`Legendary Names` are earned by legendary actions in play and awarded by the table during a `Retrospective`. This can be both good and bad. `Legendary Names` may not need to roll in certain circumstances and their fame might bring help from admirers. But they may also attract wannabes looking to become a legend by defeating one. WATCH YER BACK!


### DICE

When a character does something risky—when the cost might be meaningful—roll `1d6`; add an additional `d6` if they have a relevant `Name`. Another for a `Legendary Name` (or don't roll at all).

`Blaze of Glory`: an endgame like a `Devil's Bargain`—you get your wish, but your character dies.

Highest die is:
- 5-6 SUCCESS! Circumstance might differentiate between levels of success.
- 4 `Devil's Bargain`: players describe a reasonable success or failure—the GM describes the other, then negotiate and balance between the two.
- 1-3 nuanced failure.

#### Help
After a roll, if the fiction dictates, a character may ask another character for help. The helping player rolls (including any applicable skills) and both characters share the consequences.


#### Die of Fate

The `Die of Fate` might be rolled to establish the weather, indicate an NPC's attitude, determine moral or any number of other things. You will roll this often!

Roll 1D6:
- 5-6 something good!
- 3-4 something revealing
- 1-2 something bad


#### Injuries

- **Bruised**: punch, winded, fall, kicked in the tender bits. You might feel this in the morning but rub some dirt on it and you'll shake it off in a few minutes.
- **Bloodied**: stab, cut, internal bleeding. A night's rest should heal these but take too many and you might bleed out.
- **Broken**: rib, limb, concussed, you're done for the day—maybe the week.
- **Buried**: you're dead but maybe you can bargain with Death? You'll add a new `Name` (eg. _Marked by Death_)... I'm sure it'll be fine... Death is a nice guy?


### MAGIC

Magic is an innate gift that connects a mage to the world. The world is full of magic and a mage communes with it. Air, tree, stone, ocean, star; all allies of the mage. With proper knowledge, a mage may petition the world for indulgence—favors, if you like. Given their relationship is in good standing, the world is likely to comply.

Magi are born with this gift but it requires development. Some learn spells from tomes and scrolls while others may intuit them. Magic is like music: some can, some can't; some read, some intuit.

- ask a stone to gather its brethren and create a road
- ask the air to withhold itself from a creature until it is unconscious
- ask a still lake to reflect a scene it's been witness to
- ask the moon to hold back the tide
- help tell the story of a misdeed that a forest, church, or statue cannot tell alone


#### Promises

Promises are the simplest spells—like cantrips. Often dismissed as "cheap tricks," their ephemeral quality leaves no lasting impression on the world. Yet they signify an unspoken agreement; a remnant from the bond between mage and world. Any mage worth their socks should be able to cast these simple, ephemeral spells without rolling.


#### Casting Spells

More advanced spells demand a `Totem`—something physical of the world and a representation of the intended outcome. While a `Totem` should ideally resonate with the desired effect, substitutions are possible. Salt is renowned for warding off malevolent energies, but alternatives like chalk or even ground coffee may serve adequately. Casting also requires speech and the mage's touch.

**Example Totems:**
- bark from a hanging tree
- a stone from an enemy's castle
- any manner of items found in an apothecary
- a king's slipper
- a coin from a beggar's cup

**To Cast**, roll `2d6` (or `3d6` for `Legendary Name`):
- The higher die determines success (see `DICE`)
- The lower determines impact or consequence
- Rolling snake-eyes invokes both failure _and_ a `Burden`
- A mage feeling a spell failing may accept a `Burden` and have it succeed instead. `Burdens` are an imbalance in the world and represented by a random Tarot card; an IOU to the world. Player and GM use the Tarot card and circumstance to negotiate how the `Burden` is satisfied
- Magi who take on 3 `Burdens` become lost in the world


#### Enhancement Spells

`Enhancement Spells` are woven in tandem with a primary spell, and can amplify potency, duration, or scope. While they enhance a spell's efficacy, they take time (an extra turn) and compound the risks of casting—an additional `Burden` for the mage who pushes both.


#### Rituals

Rituals are the pinnacle of magical prowess. They yield unparalleled power but demand patience and dedication. Substantial magic requires rituals that can take days, weeks, or even months. Raising a storm to sink a fleet might take a week, demand a ship’s figurehead, and be finished on the night of a new moon — but only if the caster remains fasting.

**Rituals may require:**
- time (days, weeks, or months)
- first you must [task]
- expensive/rare components
- might only achieve a partial effect
- you might need help (another mage with an appropriate alliance)
- it's dangerous
- requires a specific location, or a particular day or season

#### Summoning

Summoning ventures into the perilous realm of bargaining with the Fae. The Fae, with their long lives, are the most knowledgeable in magic. They enjoy the deepest bonds with the world. If their magic has boundaries, none are known—but with long life comes madness. Success is far from guaranteed. GOOD LUCK!

Only the Fae can bring life back to the dead.


### ENCUMBRANCE

Characters can carry what makes sense. Unless they have a `Name` that could be argued otherwise, characters can carry one or _maybe_ two bulky items. More than that and you're `Encumbered`. Bulky is defined as something that might require two hands to wield, affect balance or speed, or make tight space difficult to navigate.


### REFLECTIONS

At the end of each session, go around the table and reflect on each of the characters, one by one. Did the character earn a new Name (up to six)? Has one of their `Names` changed? Comments on the state of the game may also be discussed.

- Did you act against one of your `Names`?
- Did the world change because of you?
- How might the world remember you?

### GM MUSINGS

By the powers vested in me (which are none), I give you permission to do anything, change anything or ignore anything that results in a better game for you and your players. Forever.

### EXAMPLE PLAY

#### Combat

- **Serra** (`Former Royal Guard, Bearer of Ancient Blade`)
- **Corvus** (`Shadow Walker, Brother’s Keeper`)

> **GM**: "The Bone Knight advances, his armor clicking like old teeth. What do you do?"<br>
> **Serra**: "I want to engage him directly – blade to blade. As a Former Royal Guard, I recognize his stance and know these > types of warriors."<br>
> **GM**: "Roll with two dice since your Royal Guard training applies here."<br>
> *Rolls: 2d6 → 5, 3*<br>
> **GM**: "With a 5, you succeed! Your training serves you well. How do you want to handle this?"<br>
> **Serra**: "I feint low but strike high, using a technique I learned in the palace guard."<br>
> **GM**: "The Bone Knight's armor cracks where your blade strikes. He's Bruised, but he counters with a sweeping blow > toward your legs."<br>
> **Corvus**: "Can I help Serra? I want to distract him from the shadows."<br>
> **GM**: "Yes, roll with your Shadow Walker Name."<br>
> *Rolls: 2d6 → 2, 4*<br>
> **GM**: "With a 4, it's a Devil's Bargain. What do you think happens?"<br>
> **Corvus**: "I successfully distract him, making him miss Serra."<br>
> **GM**: "But perhaps the noise draws the attention of his skeletal attendants in the next room?"<br>
> **Corvus**: "Yup... that sounds right."<br>
> **GM**: "Perfect. Serra, you see the Bone Knight's blow go wide as Corvus creates a distraction... but you hear the rattling of bones from behind the chapel door..."<br>


#### Magic

- **Thistle** (`Hedge Witch of the Vale, Grandmother’s Student`)

> **GM**: "The plague spirits swarm through the village. What do you do?"<br>
> **Thistle**: "I need to create a barrier. I pull out my bundle of dried thornberry branches – my Totem – and begin to > whisper the old words my grandmother taught me about boundaries and protection."<br>
> **GM**: "Roll your casting."<br>
> *Rolls: 2d6 → 2, 1*<br>
> **GM**: "Ooh, both low. The magic resists. You can accept the failed spell or take a Burden to make it succeed."<br>
> **Thistle**: "Yeah, I can’t let the village down. I’ll take on a Burden to force the success."<br>
> **GM**: *Draws a Tarot card* "You pull The Tower. As your spell manifests, a shimmering thorny barrier rises around the > village... but something’s wrong. Your connection to the world feels upside down, inverted. The thorns in your hand > have drawn blood."<br>
> **Thistle**: "Worth it to save them. I need to make this right."<br>

#### Burden Resolution

- **Thistle** (`Hedge Witch of the Vale, Grandmother’s Student`)

> **GM**: "The Tower. Destruction of the established. Your protective barrier spell needs balance."<br>
> **Thistle**: "The herb wall. My grandmother and I built it, tended it for years..."<br>
> **GM**: "You’d tear it down?"<br>
> **Thistle**: "These thorns in my blood... yes. One barrier for another. The scattered herbs might even protect others."<br>
> **GM**: "A fitting price. Show me how you do it."<br>
