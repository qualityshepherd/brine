_**Of Yarn and Bone** is a conversation-first game of identity with stakes, magic with awe, and play with trust._

### WHO IN THE WORLD ARE YOU?

Your character is a product of the world—they start with three `Names` that describe their place in it. `Names` are epithets that might be a role they fill, an identity or something whispered about them. They are actionable, used in play, and may change or be awarded (up to six total).

1. Create three `Names` that define your character; here are some prompts to help:

- What role does your character have in the world? eg. Reluctant Captain, Aging Herbalist, The Fixer
- Anything from their past? eg. Orphaned Princess, Butcher's Daughter, Owes a Blood Debt
- What trait describes them? eg. Ruthless, Haunted, Unshakeable
- Do they have a strong relationship? eg. Widow's Son, The Last of My Line, Sworn to Protect Her
- Are they known for something? eg. The Witness, Ship Thief, Speaks With Stones
- Do they own something of note? eg. The Good Ship Revenge, My Father's Blade, The Broken Crown
- Do they have a strong belief? eg. The Land Remembers, No Gods No Masters, The Way of the Snail

2. Write down three words that describe your character's look, features or vibe
3. Name your character

Your character has typical gear based on their `Names`. Consider making extravagant gear a `Name`.

#### Legendary Names

`Legendary Names` are earned by legendary actions in play—the things people write songs about—and awarded by the table during `Reflections`. This can be both good and bad. `Legendary Names` may not need to roll in certain circumstances and their fame might bring help from admirers. They may also attract wannabes looking to become a legend by defeating one. WATCH YER BACK!


### DICE

When a character does something risky—when the cost might be meaningful—roll `1d6`; add an additional `d6` if they have a relevant `Name`. Another for a `Legendary Name` (or don't roll at all). **Something changes after every roll**.

**Highest die** determines success:
- 5-6 SUCCESS! Circumstance might differentiate between levels of success.
- 4 `Devil's Bargain`: the player describes a reasonable success or failure—the GM describes the other, then negotiate and balance between the two.
- 1-3 nuanced failure.

**Lower die** measures the stakes presented in the fiction—how effective your success or how severe your failure:
- Combat: *Rolls: 2d6 → 6, 5* you succeed and deal serious damage
- Climbing: *Rolls: 2d6 → 6, 2* you reach the top but you're exhausted and exposed
- *Rolls: 2d6 → 3, 1* you fail and leave yourself in a bad spot
- No Relevant `Name`: nobody needs training to slice a throat... but the fictional positioning required likely negates the need to roll the *1d6*

`Blaze of Glory`: a final, desperate act. Like `Devil’s Bargain`, you get what you want, but your character dies achieving it.

#### Injuries

- **Bruised**: punch, winded, fall, kicked in the tender bits. You might feel this in the morning but rub some dirt on it and you'll shake it off in a few minutes.
- **Bloodied**: stab, cut, internal bleeding. A good night's rest and some treatment should heal these but take too many and you might bleed out.
- **Broken**: rib, limb, concussed, you're done for the day—maybe the week.
- **Buried**: you're dead but maybe you can bargain with Death? You'll add a new `Name`. I'm sure it'll be fine... Death is a nice guy?

#### Help
After a roll, if the fiction dictates, a character may ask another character for help. The helping player rolls (including any applicable `Names`) and both characters share the consequences.

#### Die of Fate

The `Die of Fate` might be rolled to establish the weather, indicate an NPC's attitude, determine morale or any number of other things. You will roll this often!

Roll 1D6:
- 5-6 something good!
- 3-4 something revealing
- 1-2 something bad


### MAGIC

The world is full of magic and a mage communes with it. Air, tree, stone, ocean, star; all allies of the mage. With proper knowledge, a mage may petition the world for indulgence—favors, if you like. Given their relationship is in good standing, the world is likely to comply.

Magi are born with this gift but it requires development. Some learn spells from tomes and scrolls while others may intuit them. Magic is like music: some can, some can't; some read, some intuit.

A mage asks the world to do what it _wants_ to do, deliberately. Stones gather. Air stills. Water reflects. Moon watches. Vines tangle. Fire consumes. Ask the world to act against its nature and risk refusal.

- ask a stone to gather its brethren and create a road
- ask the air to withhold itself from a creature until it is unconscious
- ask a still lake to reflect a scene it's been witness to
- ask the moon to hold back the tide
- ask vines to ensnare a foe
- ask a flame to cage a foe


#### Promises

Promises are the simplest spells—like cantrips. Often dismissed as _cheap tricks_, their ephemeral quality leaves no lasting impression on the world. Yet they signify an unspoken agreement; a remnant from the bond between mage and world. Any mage worth their socks should be able to cast these simple, ephemeral spells without rolling.


#### Casting Spells

More advanced spells demand a `Totem`—something physical of the world and a representation of the intended outcome. A piece of something remembers the whole: blood knows the blade, a stone recalls its wall, hair is still _of_ its owner. While a `Totem` should ideally resonate with the desired effect, substitutions are possible. Salt is renowned for warding off malevolent energies, but alternatives like chalk or even ground coffee may serve adequately. Casting also requires speech and the mage's touch.

**Example Totems:**
- bark from a hanging tree
- a stone from an enemy's castle
- any manner of items found in an apothecary
- a king's slipper
- a coin from a beggar's cup

**To Cast**, roll `2d6` (or `3d6` for `Legendary Name`):
- The higher die determines success (see #DICE)
- The lower determines impact or consequence
- A mage feeling a spell failing may accept a `Burden` and have it succeed instead. `Burdens` are an imbalance in the world and represented by a random Tarot card. Player and GM use the Tarot card and circumstance to negotiate how the Burden is satisfied. The world _will_ be repaid—immediately, in time or both.
- Rolling snake-eyes invokes both failure _and_ a `Burden`
- Magi who take on 3 `Burdens` become lost in the world

#### Enhancement Spells

`Enhancement Spells` are woven in tandem with a primary spell, and can amplify potency, duration, or scope. While they enhance a spell's efficacy, they take time (an extra turn) and compound the risks of casting. A mage that pushes a failing Enhancement (or rolls snake-eyes) takes two `Burdens`.

- A mage cages a foe in flame, along with an Enhancement to hold it burning until dawn.


#### Rituals

Rituals are the pinnacle of magical prowess. They yield unparalleled power but demand patience and dedication. Substantial magic requires rituals that can take days, weeks, or even months. Raising a storm to sink a fleet might take a week, demand a ship’s figurehead, and be finished on the night of a new moon — but only if the caster remains fasting.

**Rituals may require:**
- time (days, weeks, or months)
- a task
- expensive/rare components
- might only achieve a partial effect
- help from another mage
- something dangerous
- a specific location, day or season

#### Summoning

Summoning ventures into the perilous realm of bargaining with the Fae. The Fae, with their long lives, are the most knowledgeable in magic. They enjoy the deepest bonds with the world. If their magic has boundaries, none are known—but with long life comes madness. Success is far from guaranteed. GOOD LUCK!

_Only the Fae can restore life to the dead._


### ENCUMBRANCE

Characters can carry what makes sense. Unless they have a `Name` that could be argued otherwise, characters can carry one or _maybe_ two bulky items. More than that and you're `Encumbered`. Bulky is defined as something that might require two hands to wield, affect balance or speed, or make tight space difficult to navigate.


### REFLECTIONS

At the end of each session, go around the table and reflect on each of the characters in turn. Have they earned a new `Name` (up to six) or let an old one go? You may also reflect on how the story or the world has changed.

- Have any of your `Names` changed, faded, or taken on new meaning?
- Did your actions honor your `Names` or twist them into something else?
- Does the world speak differently about you now?

When it feels right, grant your character a new `Name`, or let one be forgotten.


### RULE ZERO

0. By the powers vested in me (which are none), I give you permission to do anything, change anything or ignore anything that results in a better game for you and your players. Forever.

### EXAMPLE PLAY

#### Combat

- **Serra** (`Former Royal Guard, Bearer of Ancient Blade`)
- **Corvus** (`Shadow Walker, Brother’s Keeper`)

> **GM**: "The Bone Knight advances, his armor clicking like old teeth. What do you do?"<br>
> **Serra**: "I want to engage him directly – blade to blade. As a Former Royal Guard, I recognize his stance and know these > types of warriors."<br>
> **GM**: "Roll with two dice since your Royal Guard training applies here."<br>
> *Rolls: 2d6 → 5, 3*<br>
> **GM**: "With a 5, you succeed! You strike true, but the impact is minor—he’s Bruised."<br>
> **Serra**: "I feint low but strike high, using a technique I learned in the palace guard."<br>
> **GM**: "The Bone Knight's armor cracks where your blade strikes. He's Bruised, but he counters with a sweeping blow > toward your legs."<br>
> **Corvus**: "Can I help Serra? I want to distract him from the shadows."<br>
> **GM**: "Yes, roll with your Shadow Walker Name."<br>
> *Rolls: 2d6 → 2, 4*<br>
> **GM**: "With a 4, it's a Devil's Bargain. What do you think happens?"<br>
> **Corvus**: "I successfully distract him, making him miss Serra."<br>
> **GM**: "But perhaps the noise draws the attention of his skeletal attendants in the next room?"<br>
> **Corvus**: "Yup... that sounds right."<br>
> **GM**: "Perfect. Serra, you see the Bone Knight's blow go wide as Corvus creates a distraction... but you hear the rattling of bones from behind the chapel door..."<br>


#### Magic

- **Thistle** (`Hedge Witch of the Vale, Grandmother’s Student`)

> **GM**: "The plague spirits swarm through the village. What do you do?"<br>
> **Thistle**: "I need to create a barrier. I pull out my bundle of dried thornberry branches – my Totem – and begin to whisper the old words my grandmother taught me about boundaries and protection."<br>
> **GM**: "Roll your casting."<br>
> *Rolls: 2d6 → 2, 1*<br>
> **GM**: "Ooh, both low. The magic resists and the spirits are descending on the villagers. You can accept the failed spell or take a Burden to make it succeed."<br>
> **Thistle**: "Yeah, I can’t let the village down. I’ll take on a Burden to force the success."<br>
> **GM**: *Draws a Tarot card* "You pull The Tower. As your spell manifests, a shimmering thorny barrier rises around the > village...

#### Burden Resolution

- **Thistle** (`Hedge Witch of the Vale, Grandmother’s Student`)

> **GM**: "The Tower. Destruction of the established. You took on this Burden to save the town. Ballance must be restored, now or in the future."<br>
> **Thistle**: "The herb wall. My grandmother and I built it, tended it for years..."<br>
> **GM**: "You’d tear it down?"<br>
> **Thistle**: "Yes. One barrier for another. The scattered herbs might even protect others."<br>
> **GM**: "A fitting price. Show me how you do it..."<br>

#### Spells

- **Rowan** (Wandering Mage, Stone Speaker, Hunted by the Ironwood Clan)

> **GM**: You're trapped in the cave. Thirty goblins outside have piled brush at the entrance and set it ablaze. Smoke is filling the cave. They're between you and the forest. What do you do?

**Some magical solutions discussed at the table**:
- Ask cave stone to remember the passage it once was; find the old water channel, create a back exit
- Ask air to rush outward violently and blast the brush fire to scatter the goblins
- Ask fire to consume the brush quickly, burn hot and fast before the smoke kills you (risk: might spread to the forest)
- Ask water seeping through the cave walls to gather and reflect what it's seen: the goblins' positions
- Combine a LOUD VOICE Promise with rumbling rocks underfoot to scare them off
- Ally with the trees. Convince them these axe-wielding goblins will be upon them next
- Ask briars to tangle (with Enhancement to affect enough goblins to route the rest)

> **Rowan**: I'll use the smoke itself. Ask it to billow and shroud me as I slip out toward the forest.
> **GM**: Smart. Roll your casting with Stone Speaker—smoke isn't quite your specialty but you're working with natural elements.
