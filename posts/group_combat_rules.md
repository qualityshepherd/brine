A character was fighting a bunch of wraiths and found my regular combat rules weren't cutting it. I just threw something together for the meantime but later crafted them into this...

### GROUP COMBAT

When groups fight, _zoom out_. Use the following threat levels to track the situation: 
1. **Fair Fight** - you have the tools or positioning to handle this
2. **Dangerous** - you are outmatched OR outnumbered
3. **Deadly** - you are outmatched AND outnumbered
4. **Overwhelmed** - you shouldn't be fighting this

Compare the roll (lower die in OYAB) to the current level to gauge effectiveness and consequences. Adjust level as conditions change (enemies eliminated, tools found, environment shifts, etc...).

**Example:** Three wraiths attack (`Deadly`). You roll `2d6 → 6, 3`. Success (6), moderate effect (3 vs. `Deadly`). You destroy one wraith. The situation shifts to `Dangerous` (two remain).
