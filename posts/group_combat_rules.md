A character was fighting a bunch of wraiths and found my regular combat rules weren't cutting it. I just threw something together for the meantime but later crafted them into this...

### GROUP COMBAT

When groups fight, _zoom out_. Use the following threat levels to track the situation: 
1. **Fair Fight** - you have the tools or positioning to handle this
2. **Dangerous** - you are outmatched OR outnumbered
3. **Deadly** - you are outmatched AND outnumbered
4. **Overwhelmed** - you shouldn't be fighting this

Roll `2d6` (as per [OYAB](https://brine.dev/#post?s=of_yarn_and_bone)) - high die for success, low die compared to threat level for impact:
- Beats threat: significant impact - eliminate enemies, gain ground
- Matches threat: moderate impact - take down one, hold position  
- Below threat: minimal impact - losing ground, threat worsens

Adjust threat level when conditions change:
- Drop: eliminate enemies, gain advantage, secure position
- Raise: reinforcements, lose advantage, environment worsens

**Example:** Three wraiths attack (`Deadly`). You roll `2d6 → 6, 3`. Success (6), moderate effect (3 vs. `Deadly`). You destroy one wraith. The situation shifts to `Dangerous` (two remain).
