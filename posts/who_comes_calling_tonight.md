<div class="song">
<div>
Torrential rain in Ravencross
washed over Blackthorn Lane
Lucinda got her stockings wet
when she called on Edmund Graves
all along the wrought-iron gate
the shadows scratch and claw
while drops the size of bullets
strike the eaves with wild applause

Who comes calling tonight?

The bells of St. Sebastian
ignore the midnight toll
swallowed whole in darkness
black as buried coal
vestry candles sanctify
unrequited prayers
Reverend Drake stands trembling
gazing down the chancel stairs

Who comes calling tonight?

Down in Cinder’s Hollow
the bloodwood branches bow
penitent obedience
concealing furrowed brows
the night itself takes umbrage
growing cold as graveyard stone
the moon withdraws her troubled gaze
some things cannot come home

Who comes calling tonight?

</div>
