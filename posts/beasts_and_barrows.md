**Beasts & Barrows** is an uncomplicated fantasy role-playing game (RPG) for 2-5 players + Game Maestro (GM). It steals blatantly from John Harper's [World of Dungeons](http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf) and shares the same [PbtA](http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta) core mechanic (`2d6`). ~~YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO HACK THIS!~~

**Beasts & Barrows (B&B)** values:
  - **role-play:** rules and mechanics emphasize and encourage role-play
  - **simplicity:** less math; less rules; more fun
  - **show, don't tell:** don't _tell_ me your alignment... _show_ me your alignment; don't _tell_ me you attack; _describe_ your attack
  - **flexibility:** running existing adventures from _any_ system is trivial

### Character Creation

**What kind of character sounds fun to play?** Rolling a new character takes _ones of minutes_. This question will likely take the longest to answer. Here are some classic examples but you are free to create your own:

  - **Warrior:** strong and good with the stabby stab
  - **Thief:** nimble and sneaky sneaksters
  - **Mage:** smart and full of arcaney goodness
  - **Priest:** wise and has a direct line to the gods

> Outside of the _classic classes_, players are encouraged to create their own by making clever use of the existing `Skills and Abilities`. For example an **Alchemist** might require `Lore` and create their potions via `Rituals`?

**What race is your character?** Human? Elf? Orc? While there are no statistical bonuses for race, they can add flavor to a character through role-play.

> The _exception that proves the rule_: GMs may allow PCs to have `darkvision` or an additional `language`, provided the player offers sound reasoning to do so.

**What `Attributes` does your character have?** Roll `2d6` for each of the following six character `Attributes` and assign the results in any order you wish.

  - **strength (`str`):** for melee attacks; climbing; lifting
  - **dexterity (`dex`):** for ranged attacks; stealth; dodging
  - **intelligence (`int`):** for casting mage spells; memory; deduction
  - **wisdom (`wis`):** for casting cleric spells; perception; searching
  - **charisma (`cha`):** for persuasion; deception; intimidation
  - **constitution (`con`):** for additional HD; physical fortitude; resist poisons;

On a:
  - **2** the value is -1
  - **3-6** the value is 0
  - **7-9** the value is +1
  - **10-11**, the value is +2
  - **12**, the value is +3.

> Note: **B&B** only makes use of **modifiers** (eg. `+2`); not the number rolled.

**Choose two `Skills` and two `Abilities`:**

#### Skills
When a PC attempts something in the fiction that might be covered by a skill (eg. Athletics when climbing), they roll _advantage_ (`3d6` keeping the highest 2) `+ mod`.

- **Athletics:** `+str/dex`: feats of strength and dexterity
- **Awareness:** `+wis`: perceiving the environment around you
- **Deception:** `+cha`: attempt to deceive
- **Decipher:** `+int`: attempt to discern patterns in texts, symbols or numbers
- **Heal:** `+wis`: provide an extra `Hit Die (HD)` to the party when resting/rolling `Hit Points (HP)`; heal `1d6+level HP` with your touch.
- **Lore:** `+int`: consult your accumulated knowledge about something
- **Stealth:** `+dex`: attempt to be sneaky
- **Survival:** `+con/wis`: foraging, hunting; start a fire in unfavorable conditions, etc
- **Sway:** `+cha`: use leverage to influence someone; diplomacy; intimidate; parley

#### Abilities
Add additional flavor to a class. The word _attempt_ will generally signify rolling a `2d6+mod` when applicable.

- **Backstab:** +3 damage from concealment
- **Bless:** anoint items with holy water for +/-3 damage and as magical
- **[Cantrips](https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=cantrip):** cast 3 simple magical spells at will
- **[Cast](http://lvh.me:4242/#spells):** cast level-less magical spells (see `Magic`)
- **Connected:** you seem to have an acquaintance in every town
- **Hardy:** +6 `HP`
- **Linguist:** you are fluent in all civilized languages
- **Lucky:** turn a miss into a partial success once per day
- **Penitent:** when you take damage and embrace the pain, take advantage on your next roll
- **Pet:** you have a loyal and _effective_ animal companion
- **Reflexes:** you always act first and cannot be surprised
- **Ritual:** attempt occult rituals; detailed in ancient tomes and scrolls
- **Scout:** with you on point, your party covers more ground; you always spot targets before they spot you
- **Shield:** when you wear no armor or shield, your faith protects you and grants you 2 armor
- **Shift:** take the shape of an animal whose blood you've tasted (successful `con` roll to revert)
- **Skirmish:** +1 damage; worn armor counts as one type lighter
- **Slay:** +2 melee damage
- **Tinker:** pick a lock, pocket or trap w/ tools
- **Tough:** +1 armor
- **Turn:** attempt to hold undead at bay with your faith and holy symbol
- **Versed:** you share secret signs, speech and signals with your brethren
- **Vision:** commune with your deity or demon via holy water/drugs
- **Volley:** +2 ranged damage
- **Wild:** converse with and attempt to command animals


**Can your character take a hit?** You start with 1 Hit Die (`d6`) + additional hit dice equal to your `con`. **Roll all your hit dice and keep a number equal to your level** to determine your `HP`. For example, a 1st level PC with +1 con would roll `2d6` and keep the higher of the two.

When you rest in `comfort and safety`, and consume food/drink, you may reroll your `HP`. This is the amount of damage you can suffer before you take your `Last Breath`. You add additional hit dice if you: are attended by a healer; rest in a spiritual place.

  > A player may choose to reroll `HP` and find their PC now has _less_ `HP`. We all have bad days. Are they sick? Did they stay up drinking all night?

### Magic

**You can master spells equal to your level + 2** (eg. 1st level magi have mastered 3 spells).

Casting spells takes a physical toll. **You can safely cast spells equal to your `hd + con`** (ie. _spell slots_). Above that, you take `1d6+lvl` damage for each spell cast. Safe casting is restored after resting in _comfort and safety_.

**Mages add `int` to their casting rolls; clerics add `wis`** (eg. `2d6+int/wis`) and your `level` to damage rolls (eg. `2d6+lvl`). You gain an extra `d6` of damage at levels 5 & 10.

  > Each time you level up, you may swap mastered spells for new ones.

#### Scrolls

**You may attempt to cast spells from written texts**. This requires more casting time while you read/review the spell (ie. _a turn_) and expends a _spell slot_.

  > It is wise to identify a spell before casting it!

#### Enhancements

[_Enhancement_ spells](https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=enhancement) are cast in conjunction with a target spell. They augment spell casting and/or effect, and expend a _spell slot_ in addition to the target spell.

#### Mishaps
**Magic is dangerous**. A failed casting roll may have consequences; a critical fail always will.

An example mishap table:

  1. the target reflects the spell back at caster
  1. `1d6+lvl` damage to the caster
  3. the caster is blinded/frozen/afraid/etc... for a short time
  4. the spell affects the party in some way (depending on the spell)
  5. the caster turns blue
  6. nothing happens... _lucky you!_


### Playing the Game
**Narrate your character's actions**. Eg. instead of saying: _I attack with my sword_; say things like: _with my sword drawn; stained with the blood and entrails of the orc at my feet; I charge the last remaining orc, smiting it with both hands and all the might left in me_... _or something less dramatic :) . Don't _say_ you do a thing; _describe_ how you do a thing.

**Not all actions require a roll**. Say what your character does and the GM will handle the rest.

**When you attempt something risky**, sum `2d6` and add one of your skill modifiers, based on the action you’re taking. (The GM will tell you some of the possible consequences before you roll, so you can decide if it’s worth the risk or if you want to revise your action).

  - **2(snake eyes) is a critical failure**: shit hits the fan.
  - **3-6 is a miss**: things don’t go well and the risk turns out badly.
  - **7-9 is a partial success**: you do it but at a cost, compromise, retribution, retaliation, harm, etc.
  - **10-11 is a full success**: you do it without complications.
  - **12 (boxcars) is a critical success**: you do it perfectly to some extra benefit.

  > A miss or a partial success might incur an enemy attack; damage; an additional threat; a lost item/resource/opportunity; a disadvantage; an unwelcome truth. They add to the role-play and can amp up the tension in a scene.

#### Die of Fate
**Sometimes the GM will roll the `die of fate` to see how a situation unfolds**. Low numbers are ill-fortune; high numbers are good fortune. The die of fate might be rolled to establish the weather, indicate a random NPC’s general attitude, to determine if a wandering monster appears, or the moral of a monster. The GM may also roll the die of fate if the PCs take some action for which sheer chance is the only factor in the outcome. **You will roll this often!**

### Gear
**You have `12+con` inventory slots**. Items you can hold in one hand take one slot; items that might require two hands to hold take two slots. One slot examples: worn armor/clothes (two slots if carried); a few daggers; a bag containing 250 coins. Two slot examples: martial/great weapons; large shields; animal trap; wine casks. When carrying more items than you have slots, you are `encumbered` (disadvantage on rolls involving physicality).

> Inventory slots are meant to be more _concept than rule_. The intent is to remind players of the _useful_ items their PCs are carrying, while providing a reasonable amount they are _able_ to carry.

**You start with `2d6*10` silver coins...**

  - **Light Weapon** (10s): `d6`. May be wielded as a secondary weapon, _allowing you to reroll damage once per attack_. Includes daggers, short swords, and hand axes.

### Levels
_As you level up you get rewards according to the table below..._

level |   hd   | skills | attributes | abils| damage
:----:|:------:|:------:|:----------:|:----:|:------:
 1    | 1+con  | 1+1    |            | 2    |
 2    | +1     |        |            |      |
 3    |        | +1     |            | +1   |

**B&B** uses **Milestones** to measure a player character's development. The GM sets a goal(s) for the PCs to accomplish before they can reach the next level. Each level should be twice as hard to achieve (give or take). Milestones might include:
  - merely surviving their first encounter
  - obtaining a MacGuffin
  - completing a quest
  - defeating a boss
  - failures... always a formidable teacher

### Last Breath
When a PC's `HP` drops to 0, they must roll `2d6+con`:

  On a:
  - **6-**: you're dead; roll a new character :rip:
  - **7-9:** you will meet **Death** and bargain for your life. SPOILER: _Death can be a dick!_
  - **10+:** you feel like hammered shit... but you're alive

### True Names
True names have power; knowing a true name gives you power over _the named_. Calling to someone by their `True Name` gives them advantage on `Last Breath` rolls.

<div class="pagebreak"></div>


### GMs
The following are friendly suggestions for GMing **B&B**. As always, do what's right for you or your players.

  - **Initiative:** The coolest part of `Initiative`... is saying **roll initiative!** Given a group of reasonable size (2-5 PCs), _cinematic jump cuts_ (camera-like jumps between players/situations; that follow the narrative) are a great alternative. It also works well with a split party.
  - **Splitting the Party:** ALWAYS split the party. It's a hoot.
  - **Balancing Encounters:** Don't do it! PCs should be smart enough to know when they're outmatched. If not, there's always `Last Breath`. Outside of that, rolling new characters is a snap in **B&B** :)
  - **Magic Items:** resist issuing +1 _to hit_ items; rather give +1 to damage or something more situational
