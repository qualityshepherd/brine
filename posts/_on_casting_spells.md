_From the memoirs of Rown Varkana - Mage, Council of Six @Yagul Fane..._

My colleagues hoard their spell knowledge like dragons with gold. Can't blame them—a mage's repertoire is their livelihood. But it makes learning a bloody nightmare.

You'll find no book titled "Pyromancy for the Intermediate Practitioner" in any library. Instead, try "The Complete Guide to Smoke-Curing Meats" by someone called Therrin the Butcher. Chapter seven, between discussions of hickory and applewood, contains a perfectly serviceable fire-starting spell disguised as instructions for maintaining coals. I've also found excellent water-working hidden in "Proper Laundering of Fine Linens" and an earth-sense spell tucked into a treatise on identifying worm casings in soil.

Magi are paranoid bastards. Present company included.

## On Introductions

Now, about introductions—people misunderstand this. You already **know** stone. You've walked on it your whole life. You know water; you drink it, wash with it, wade through it. Fire? You cook with it. Air? You breathe it. These aren't formal presentations at court—they're relationships you've built since childhood without realizing it.

The introductions matter for what you *don't* encounter. A city mage has no rapport with deep ocean. A mountain dweller doesn't know swamp water. You want to petition the stars? Better find someone who's spent decades studying them, because they won't acknowledge you otherwise. Rare woods, exotic minerals, foreign winds—these require proper introduction from a mage who knows them.

But earth beneath your feet? Water from your well? You're already acquainted.

## Common Spells

**EARTH** - *Sense of Stone*  
`Promise or Totem: handful of soil, chalk, salt`  
Place your totem on the ground. Ask the earth to share what it knows—who walks nearby, what grows, where water runs beneath. The earth is old and patient. It remembers everything.

**AIR** - *Whisper on Wind*  
`Promise only, best at dawn or dusk`  
Speak your message to the air. Name your recipient—the wind needs direction. Keep it short. Wind is fast but has the attention span of a sparrow.

**FIRE** - *Candle's Memory*  
`Totem: candle, lamp oil, anything that burns`  
Fire remembers what it has consumed. Light your totem and ask—it may show you echoes of what it witnessed. Fire lies for entertainment, mind you. Recent memories are clearer.

**WATER** - *Cleansing Flow*  
`Promise or Totem: clean water, rain, morning dew`  
Pour water over the afflicted area. Water cleanses poison, infection, some curses. Won't mend broken bones, but it'll stop rot. Water gives freely.

## On Working Minds

Now for the bit most magi won't tell you about—**working on minds**.

First rule: you cannot make someone do what they don't want to do. The human mind isn't stone or water. It resists. Push too hard and you'll either fail spectacularly or earn yourself a Burden that'll haunt you for years. I knew a mage who tried forcing a merchant to hand over coin—spent the next month compulsively giving away everything he owned. Balance, remember?

The trick is **suggestion**. Make them *want* to do what you want them to do.

**MIND** - *Familiar Face*  
`Promise or Totem: something personal of yours—a button, hair, worn cloth`  
Whisper to the air around you. Suggest that you belong here, that your face is recognized, that you're meant to be present. You're not hiding—you're simply... expected. Works best on groups or distracted individuals. Someone looking directly at you with suspicion? Forget it.

**MIND** - *Urgent Concern*  
`Promise or Totem: ash, smoke, a dead leaf—something that implies threat`  
Suggest to your target that something pressing demands their attention elsewhere. Not "a demon hunts you"—that's too specific, too false. Rather, "wasn't there something you needed to check?" or "didn't you hear something?" Plant the seed of unease. Let their own mind fill in the details. They'll leave because they *thought* of a reason to, not because you commanded it.

**MIND** - *Kindred Spirit*  
`Promise only, requires eye contact`  
Suggest commonality. That you share their concerns, understand their position, see their perspective. Not friendship—that's too much—just... kinship. Makes negotiations easier. Makes people listen. Wears off when you part ways.

The key is subtlety. Suggest, don't demand. Guide, don't push. Work with what's already in their mind—their fears, their duties, their assumptions. The world will help you if you're respectful about it.

My wife says I shouldn't share this part. "People will misuse it," she says. I told her people misuse hammers too, but we still teach carpentry.
