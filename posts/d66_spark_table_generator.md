I've been playing around with **spark tables**; a concept taken from [Chris McDowall](https://www.bastionland.com). The concept is quite simple: given two numbered tables/lists of evocative words, roll on both, and use the words together to spark an idea.

This is lovely... but I wanted to create tables specific to my games/worlds, and was struggling to come up with evocative words. THUS, **a spark table to _generate_ spark tables was born!**

<break>

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Roll `2d6`: the die landing closest to you (real dice) or leftmost (dice bot) is the first digit (`10s`); the other die is the second digit (`1s`)
2. If you roll doubles, roll again and use both results
3. Use the result(s) to think of a _spark word_
4. Record each word on a similarly numbered d66 table (or as many as you want)
5. If stuck, roll for another spark, or re-roll until you spark something
6. Once you have your own spark tables, roll 2d6 on each and mash the two words together to generate ideas

_HINT: if using the doubles rule (#2), make sure those words are fairly generic as to mash well with others._
