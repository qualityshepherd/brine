    <title>Rando - An Imagination Spark Generator</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=rando-an_imagination_spark_generator</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=rando-an_imagination_spark_generator</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I love me some random generators but mine were showing my neglect and kinda all over the place. My friend <a href="https://wightbred.itch.io/">Wightbred</a> turned me onto <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/125685/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Base-Deck">GM's Apprentice Cards</a>, which inspired me to refactor and extend my own generators into a single web app. Thus, <a href="https://rando.brine.dev">Rando</a> was born.</p>
<p>Thanks to feedback from Wightbred and others, I've been able to turn Rando into a surprisingly useful tool. I was able to incorporate all the things I use for my games. I now find myself using it for everything: prep, GM &amp; Player prompts and even prompts to feed ChatGPT. And while I do not <em>solo [new verb]</em> myself, I am told that it works well for Solo Play too.</p>
<p>Give it a spin!</p>

    <title>2023 - A Gaming Year in Review</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=2023_a_gaming_year_in_review</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=2023_a_gaming_year_in_review</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>With 2023 in the rear-view, I began to reflect on the year from a gaming perspective. It turns out there are a number of things worthy of a shout-out!</p>
<h3 id="1playinggames">1. Playing Games</h3>
<p>I am a forever GM. I have run way more games than I've played. In 2023 that changed and I found myself playing a LOT more. It really opened my mind to various games and play-styles, and helped hone what I want in a game. This was definitely the biggest revelation and the reason for the rest of the list. If I was going to list a new year's resolution, it would have to be to just play more games. Here's hoping!</p>
<h3 id="2newgames">2. New Games</h3>
<p>The <del>game</del> toolset of the year for me was <a href="https://wightbred.itch.io/named-toolkit">Named</a>. I'm a big fan of playing into a character and thus, I gravitate towards tag-based character builds. Named uses epithets called--strangely enough--<code>Names</code>. While similar to tags, for my money, they add more juice. I see them as things people call your character… or whisper behind their back. This is a small but important distinction; YMMV.</p>
<p>More interesting still is how Named handles advancement through <code>Reflections</code>. At the end of a session, the table talks about what each character did in the game. Did they earn a new Name? Did a name not fit or need changing? It's easily the best advancement system I've ever seen… and now it's mine; MINE! :D</p>
<p>I was fortunate to get the full hat-trick with Named. I played it, <a href="https://playworldspodcast.com/#tags?t=skypirates-of-jotnaar">podcasted it</a> and contributed to a setting for it: <a href="https://wightbred.itch.io/skypirates-of-jotnaar">Skypirates of Jotnaar</a> (that is REALLY cool if I do say so myself).</p>
<p>Honorable mention for Dr. Paul's <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/paul-jennings-and-kitty-hiraeth/palaeolithic-voyages/paperback/product-kpmy8y.html">Palaeolithic Voyages</a>. You can keep your +1 swords; just gimme a good rock and some flint! I really wanna play more of this system.</p>
<h3 id="3newgenre">3. New Genre</h3>
<p>I played my first game of Delta Green. For whatever reason, I'm not drawn to Cthulhu games but I  dig Delta Green. It comes down to the twist: characters are not trying to solve a mystery; they are trying to stop/contain/suppress/clean up a problem. More MIB or X-Files than straight Lovecraftian cosmic horror. Really fun game.</p>
<p>I look forward to reflecting on 2024!</p>]]></description>

    <title>A TTRPG Manifesto</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_ttrpg_manifesto</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_ttrpg_manifesto</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We are exploring different approaches to TTRPGs. Through play we have come to value:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shared understanding of a world over rules</li>
<li>Table trust over systems</li>
<li>Immersion over character sheets</li>
<li>Conversation and negotiation over procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, while there is value in the elements on the right, we value the elements on the left more.</p>]]></description>

    <title>How To Hexcrawl</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=how_to_hexcrawl</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=how_to_hexcrawl</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>v1.1</em></p>
<p>Hexcrawls are awesome! They changed my game forever. But I found existing rules complex and/or included needless abstraction. Thus, I wrote my own. I also <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/hexcrawls-rule">published a pdf</a></p>
<h3 id="proceedures">PROCEEDURES</h3>
<h4 id="morning">Morning</h4>
<ol>
<li>Roll weather</li>
<li>Consume food/water</li>
<li>Break or sustain camp</li>

<ol>
<li>GM describes points of interest (POIs)/changing weather/terrain/landmarks…</li>
<li>Roll random encounters once per hex</li>
<li>Roll navigation on direction change</li>
<li>Exploring or hunting takes 1/2 day travel time</li>
<li>Foraging can be done en route when not on roads but requires a slowed pace</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="night">Night</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make camp</li>
<li>Consume food/water</li>
<li>Stand watch</li>
<li>Roll encounter</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="travel">TRAVEL</h3>
<p>Hexes are 6 miles. PCs can travel 3 hexes per day at a normal pace; 4 if moving quickly or mounted. Mountains or swamps slow the party to 1 hex per day. Pushing further risks fatigue.</p>

    <title>FKR</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=fkr</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=fkr</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>FKR</strong> (Free Kriegsspiel Roleplaying) is an approach to playing tabletop roleplaying games. Its popular catchphrase, <em>"play worlds not rules"</em> , is as reasonable as any catchphrase. Play requires the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A shared understanding of a world.</li>
<li>A Game Maestro trusted to represent "the world", and adjudicate player actions and their consequences.</li>
<li>One or more players who control a character and play the world set before them.</li>
<li>Play is a conversation. The GM describes a situation; the player describes what their character does. Outcomes are negotiated together and add to the emerging narrative.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Everything else is a preference for accomplishing these requirements. Some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rules</strong> tend to be <em>lite</em> but there is no "correct" amount. Rules should effectively be <em>"invisible"</em> and not hinder play.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>dice</strong> when it makes sense or not at all.</li>
<li>There are no FKR <strong>systems</strong>. Any system <em>might</em> be used in an FKR game. No system; a mashup of multiple systems; a coin flip… this is up to you and your table.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

<p>While ascending the Frost Spire, the crew come upon a ~roadblock~ knight in non-shining armor. As Wrath would tell you, returning from the dead is easy compared to climbing an ice tower in full plate. But the crew ties a rope around him and schleps him along (lest be stuck waiting for his slow-ass). Revenants--come to find out--like throwing rocks and punching things… who knew :shrug:</p>

    <title>Accidental FKR</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=accidental_fkr</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=accidental_fkr</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>My game has been unintentionally <em>molting</em> toward <strong>FKR</strong>. It started before ever hearing the term. It just kinda happened and I continue to enjoy its inherent permission for further mutations.</p>
<p>During a hiatus from D&amp;D 5E, I found myself reading other game systems; exploring their rules (or lack thereof) and ideas. Honestly, I hadn't put together that I wanted to run another system. I was just being curious. Bits and pieces of various systems started to click; most notably, <a href="https://dungeon-world.com">Dungeon World</a>.</p>
<p>Hilariously, I've never run Dungeon World; nor do I have interest in doing so. I don't find it to be a particularly compelling game, but rather a fantastic GM reference! Just reading it changed the way I run games. It also illuminated my want of a different ruleset: something simpler; more inclusive. I didn't need to look very far (even if I did)… DW lead me right to <a href="https://johnharper.itch.io/world-of-dungeons">World of Dungeons (WoDu)</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of things in WoDu that changed my game forever (<code>2d6</code> &amp; <code>Die of Fate</code> come to mind) but in terms of FKR, it was <em>the holes</em>. <em>What do these Skills do? How do rituals work? Decipher?</em> The old GM in me would have thought: <em>"okay, I need to figure out all this shit before we play"</em>. But thanks to my exploration of other rulesets, I was able to give myself permission to put these questions to <em>my group</em>. My players really took to this inclusive approach to rule creation. It's very likely why we've been playing for so long (going on 3 years)! Lighter rules also lead to less character sheet-gazing and more creativity. I was hooked!</p>
<p>Two years later, I published some of these <em>house rules</em> as <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/beasts-barrows">Beasts & Barrows</a>. But shortly thereafter, even BnB started feeling heavy to me. So with an inspiring nudge from <a href="https://jasontocci.itch.io/2400">2400</a>, I took another step and revamped them into their new, unfinished form: <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/1420-bnb">1420 Beasts & Barrows</a>. The most notable differences being the lack of stats and d6 dice pool skills. This new ruleset is currently peculating with my regular crew.</p>
<p>For the record, I have no desire to debate what is/isn't FKR. I am not an authority; nor do I wish to be. I purposely refrained from explaining it or linking it to anything here. I prefer its definition to remain elusive and open. I find my game jives with the idea of FKR more than other rpg philosophies (for lack of a better term). YMMV.</p>]]></description>

    <title>D66 Spark Table Generator</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=d66_spark_table_generator</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=d66_spark_table_generator</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing around with <strong>spark tables</strong>; a concept taken from <a href="https://www.bastionland.com">Chris McDowall</a>. The concept is quite simple: given two numbered tables/lists of evocative words, roll on both, and use the words together to spark an idea.</p>
<p>This is lovely… but I wanted to create tables specific to my games/worlds, and was struggling to come up with evocative words. THUS, <strong>a spark table to <em>generate</em> spark tables was born!</strong></p>
<p><break></p>
<h2 id="instructions">INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Roll <code>2d6</code>: the die landing closest to you (real dice) or leftmost (dice bot) is the first digit (<code>10s</code>); the other die is the second digit (<code>1s</code>)</li>
<li>If you roll doubles, roll again and use both results</li>
<li>Use the result(s) to think of a <em>spark word</em></li>
<li>Record each word on a similarly numbered d66 table (or as many as you want)</li>
<li>If stuck, roll for another spark, or re-roll until you spark something</li>
<li>Once you have your own spark tables, roll 2d6 on each and mash the two words together to generate ideas</li>
</ol>
<p><em>HINT: if using the doubles rule (#2), make sure those words are fairly generic as to mash well with others.</em></p>

<p>I like adventure modules. I especially like the newer ones… that are <em>actually</em> modular. Short, open-ended adventures that are trivial to drop into any campaign. Scanable; easy to grok. This is thankfully becoming the norm; fighting against the epic walls-of-text, and endless lore from modules of yore. This is what I want and what <em>I want to write</em>.</p>
<p><break></p>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/delve-of-the-handsome-repeater">Delve of the Handsome Repeater</a> was born. This is my <em>hat</em> tossed into the ring of an ever-growing list of newer adventures.</p>
<p>To be honest: I find dungeons and dungeon crawls boring; mega dungeons <em>mega</em> boring. So it's only fitting that my first published module (more or less) should be a dungeon ¯_(ツ)_/¯. I hoped writing one would open my eyes to the GLORRY THAT IS DUNGEON CRAWLING! Spoiler… it didn't.</p>
<p>Anyway, here it is. It was fun to write and fun to play… I hope others find it enjoyable.</p>]]></description>

    <title>On Vancian Magic</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=on_vancian_magic</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=on_vancian_magic</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>When writing my <a href="#post?s=a_magic_system">magic system</a> for <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/beasts-barrows">Beasts & Barrows</a>, I had two goals: keep it simple and <em>somewhat</em> logical. Towards simplicity, I reused the existing game mechanics: <code>2d6</code>, <code>attributes</code> and <code>level</code>. I also considered using Necropraxis' fabulous <a href="https://www.necropraxis.com/2013/11/01/spell-dice">spell dice</a> but simplicity won out.</p>
<p>Making the system logical took a lot more thought.</p>
<p>Several people describe my magic system as <em>Vancian</em> (ie. spells must be prepared daily; have a fixed purpose and finite usage). <strong>I did not set out to make my system specifically <em>non-Vancian</em></strong>. This is good because when I think about it, it really is quite Vancian… but with <em>twists.</em></p>
<p><break></p>
<p>First twist: preparation. It's silly to expect magi to prepare spells every day. It <em>does</em> make sense that spells are learned, practiced and <em>mastered</em>. We see this in Harry Potter; the kids all practicing enunciation and wand flicking. But this leans more toward <em>practice</em> than preparation. It's also logical that magi have a limited number of spells they've <em>mastered</em>. This number increases as their experience increases. <strong>I want players thinking of creative ways to use the spells they have</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Spellbooks</em>. What dolt-of-a-mage cannot memorize a few spells? Must they write them all down in a book? If they're without that book, can they no longer cast a spell? Lame. No. But books <em>are</em> quite useful. <strong>Magi can read and cast <em>unfamiliar</em> spells from scrolls and books</strong>, but it takes more time (a turn). It also incentivizes <em>scroll hunts</em>. Fun!</p>
<p>Which leads us to usage. It's ridiculous that a mage would forget a spell after casting it. Same goes for it vanishing from their spellbook. No. That's crazytown. The twist here is that casting spells takes a physical toll. A mage can safely cast spells, based on their stamina (<code>con</code>), and have it scale with their experience (<code>hd</code>). This could have also been level but I feel like <code>hd</code> is a bit closer to health… same diff. <strong>Cast all the spells you want… but it will eventually hurt</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have <em>spells with a fixed purpose</em>. Spell authors will have a lot to say about this. But a few twists can keep them simple and allow for more creative usage. I love <strong>levelless spells</strong>. I can see an argument that spell level denotes complexity or whatever… but I prefer to let a mage learn whatever spell they like. I also added <a href="#spellTags?t=enhancement">enhancement spells</a>. Spells that enhance a target spell but cost an extra spell slot. This helps keep spells simple and flexible.</p>]]></description>

    <title>I Published a Thing</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=i_published_a_thing</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/beasts-barrows"><img src="assets/images/bnb-630x500.png" alt="center" /></a></p>
<p>I didn't set out to write a system… I swear. It just <em>happened</em>.</p>
<p>Here's how it goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>run a oneshot to play around with <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a></li>
<li>the players; the system; the characters… they all click and it's fun</li>
<li>a campaign begins!</li>
<li>during your campaign, start hacking bits of the system to the tastes of yourself and your players
<break></li>
<li>players don't like the magic system? <a href="/#post?s=a_magic_system">write your own</a></li>
<li>hack even more stuff in the second year of your campaign</li>
<li>struggle to explain all the hacks to new players</li>
<li>write it all down</li>
<li>fine… I'll publish it 🙄</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> _there's no <code>10. profit</code></p>
<p>Personally, I wish people would publish fewer systems and publish more adventures. But here I am…. publishing a system. But it's funny with systems: they're <em>personal</em>. <strong>Finding a system that suits your style and hacking off the bits that get in the way should be second nature to a GM</strong>. Continue hacking to the point where it requires a new telling of the rules? Congratulations! You're now a publisher.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> plan on writing &amp; publishing adventures. Time will tell what other little distractions I'll encounter along the way.</p>
<p>Stay tuned…</p>]]></description>

    <title>Beasts &amp; Barrows</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=beasts_and_barrows</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=beasts_and_barrows</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="https://brine.dev">brine</a> - <version><em>v 1.0</em></version></p>
<p><strong>Beasts & Barrows</strong> is an uncomplicated fantasy role-playing game (RPG) for 2-5 players + Game Maestro (GM). It steals blatantly from John Harper's <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a> and shares the same <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta">PbtA</a> core mechanic (<code>2d6</code>). <del>YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO HACK THIS!</del></p>
<p><strong>Beasts & Barrows (B&B)</strong> values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>role-play:</strong> rules and mechanics emphasize and encourage role-play</li>
<li><strong>simplicity:</strong> less math; less rules; more fun</li>
<li><strong>show, don't tell:</strong> don't <em>tell</em> me your alignment… <em>show</em> me your alignment; don't <em>tell</em> me you attack; <em>describe</em> your attack</li>
<li><strong>flexibility:</strong> running existing adventures from <em>any</em> system is trivial</li>
</ul>
<p><break></p>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="charactercreation">Character Creation</h3>
<p><strong>What kind of character sounds fun to play?</strong> Rolling a new character takes <em>ones of minutes</em>. This question will likely take the longest to answer. Here are some classic examples but you are free to create your own:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior:</strong> strong and good with the stabby stab</li>
<li><strong>Thief:</strong> nimble and sneaky sneaksters</li>
<li><strong>Mage:</strong> smart and full of arcaney goodness</li>
<li><strong>Priest:</strong> wise and has a direct line to the gods</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Outside of the <em>classic classes</em>, players are encouraged to create their own by making clever use of the existing <code>Skills and Abilities</code>. For example an <strong>Alchemist</strong> might require <code>Lore</code> and create their potions via <code>Rituals</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What race is your character?</strong> Human? Elf? Orc? While there are no statistical bonuses for race, they can add flavor to a character through role-play.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>exception that proves the rule</em>: GMs may allow PCs to have <code>darkvision</code> or an additional <code>language</code>, provided the player offers sound reasoning to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What <code>Attributes</code> does your character have?</strong> Roll <code>2d6</code> for each of the following six character <code>Attributes</code> and assign the results in any order you wish.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>strength (<code>str</code>):</strong> for melee attacks; climbing; lifting</li>
<li><strong>dexterity (<code>dex</code>):</strong> for ranged attacks; stealth; dodging</li>
<li><strong>intelligence (<code>int</code>):</strong> for casting mage spells; memory; deduction</li>
<li><strong>wisdom (<code>wis</code>):</strong> for casting cleric spells; perception; searching</li>
<li><strong>charisma (<code>cha</code>):</strong> for persuasion; deception; intimidation</li>
<li><strong>constitution (<code>con</code>):</strong> for additional HD; physical fortitude; resist poisons;</li>
</ul>
<p>On a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> the value is -1</li>
<li><strong>3-6</strong> the value is 0</li>
<li><strong>7-9</strong> the value is +1</li>
<li><strong>10-11</strong>, the value is +2</li>
<li><strong>12</strong>, the value is +3.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: <strong>B&B</strong> only makes use of <strong>modifiers</strong> (eg. <code>+2</code>); not the number rolled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Choose two <code>Skills</code> and two <code>Abilities</code>:</strong></p>
<h4 id="skills">Skills</h4>
<p>When a PC attempts something in the fiction that might be covered by a skill (eg. Athletics when climbing), they roll <em>advantage</em> (<code>3d6</code> keeping the highest 2) <code>+ mod</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Athletics:</strong> <code>+str/dex</code>: feats of strength and dexterity</li>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: perceiving the environment around you</li>
<li><strong>Deception:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: attempt to deceive</li>
<li><strong>Decipher:</strong> <code>+int</code>: attempt to discern patterns in texts, symbols or numbers</li>
<li><strong>Heal:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: provide an extra <code>Hit Die (HD)</code> to the party when resting/rolling <code>Hit Points (HP)</code>; heal <code>1d6+level HP</code> with your touch.</li>
<li><strong>Lore:</strong> <code>+int</code>: consult your accumulated knowledge about something</li>
<li><strong>Stealth:</strong> <code>+dex</code>: attempt to be sneaky</li>
<li><strong>Survival:</strong> <code>+con/wis</code>: foraging, hunting; start a fire in unfavorable conditions, etc</li>
<li><strong>Sway:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: use leverage to influence someone; diplomacy; intimidate; parley</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="abilities">Abilities</h4>
<p>Add additional flavor to a class. The word <em>attempt</em> will generally signify rolling a <code>2d6+mod</code> when applicable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backstab:</strong> +3 damage from concealment</li>
<li><strong>Bless:</strong> anoint items with holy water for +/-3 damage and as magical</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=cantrip">Cantrips</a>:</strong> cast 3 simple magical spells at will</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://lvh.me:4242/#spells">Cast</a>:</strong> cast level-less magical spells (see <code>Magic</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Connected:</strong> you seem to have an acquaintance in every town</li>
<li><strong>Hardy:</strong> +6 <code>HP</code></li>
<li><strong>Linguist:</strong> you are fluent in all civilized languages</li>
<li><strong>Lucky:</strong> turn a miss into a partial success once per day</li>
<li><strong>Penitent:</strong> when you take damage and embrace the pain, take advantage on your next roll</li>
<li><strong>Pet:</strong> you have a loyal and <em>effective</em> animal companion</li>
<li><strong>Reflexes:</strong> you always act first and cannot be surprised</li>
<li><strong>Ritual:</strong> attempt occult rituals; detailed in ancient tomes and scrolls</li>
<li><strong>Scout:</strong> with you on point, your party covers more ground; you always spot targets before they spot you</li>
<li><strong>Shield:</strong> when you wear no armor or shield, your faith protects you and grants you 2 armor</li>
<li><strong>Shift:</strong> take the shape of an animal whose blood you've tasted (successful <code>con</code> roll to revert)</li>
<li><strong>Skirmish:</strong> +1 damage; worn armor counts as one type lighter</li>
<li><strong>Slay:</strong> +2 melee damage</li>
<li><strong>Tinker:</strong> pick a lock, pocket or trap w/ tools</li>
<li><strong>Tough:</strong> +1 armor</li>
<li><strong>Turn:</strong> attempt to hold undead at bay with your faith and holy symbol</li>
<li><strong>Versed:</strong> you share secret signs, speech and signals with your brethren</li>
<li><strong>Vision:</strong> commune with your deity or demon via holy water/drugs</li>
<li><strong>Volley:</strong> +2 ranged damage</li>
<li><strong>Wild:</strong> converse with and attempt to command animals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can your character take a hit?</strong> You start with 1 Hit Die (<code>d6</code>) + additional hit dice equal to your <code>con</code>. <strong>Roll all your hit dice and keep a number equal to your level</strong> to determine your <code>HP</code>. For example, a 1st level PC with +1 con would roll <code>2d6</code> and keep the higher of the two.</p>
<p>When you rest in <code>comfort and safety</code>, and consume food/drink, you may reroll your <code>HP</code>. This is the amount of damage you can suffer before you take your <code>Last Breath</code>. You add additional hit dice if you: are attended by a healer; rest in a spiritual place.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A player may choose to reroll <code>HP</code> and find their PC now has <em>less</em> <code>HP</code>. We all have bad days. Are they sick? Did they stay up drinking all night?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
<p><strong>You can master spells equal to your level + 2</strong> (eg. 1st level magi have mastered 3 spells).</p>
<p>Casting spells takes a physical toll. <strong>You can safely cast spells equal to your <code>hd + con</code></strong> (ie. <em>spell slots</em>). Above that, you take <code>1d6+lvl</code> damage for each spell cast. Safe casting is restored after resting in <em>comfort and safety</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Mages add <code>int</code> to their casting rolls; clerics add <code>wis</code></strong> (eg. <code>2d6+int/wis</code>) and your <code>level</code> to damage rolls (eg. <code>2d6+lvl</code>). You gain an extra <code>d6</code> of damage at levels 5 &amp; 10.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Each time you level up, you may swap mastered spells for new ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h4>
<p><strong>You may attempt to cast spells from written texts</strong>. This requires more casting time while you read/review the spell (ie. <em>a turn</em>) and expends a <em>spell slot</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is wise to identify a spell before casting it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h4>
<p><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=enhancement"><em>Enhancement</em> spells</a> are cast in conjunction with a target spell. They augment spell casting and/or effect, and expend a <em>spell slot</em> in addition to the target spell.</p>
<h4 id="mishaps">Mishaps</h4>
<p><strong>Magic is dangerous</strong>. A failed casting roll may have consequences; a critical fail always will.</p>
<p>An example mishap table:</p>
<ol>
<li>the target reflects the spell back at caster</li>
<li><code>1d6+lvl</code> damage to the caster</li>
<li>the caster is blinded/frozen/afraid/etc… for a short time</li>
<li>the spell affects the party in some way (depending on the spell)</li>
<li>the caster turns blue</li>
<li>nothing happens… <em>lucky you!</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="playingthegame">Playing the Game</h3>
<p><strong>Narrate your character's actions</strong>. Eg. instead of saying: <em>I attack with my sword</em>; say things like: <em>with my sword drawn; stained with the blood and entrails of the orc at my feet; I charge the last remaining orc, smiting it with both hands and all the might left in me</em>… _or something less dramatic :) . Don't _say_ you do a thing; <em>describe</em> how you do a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Not all actions require a roll</strong>. Say what your character does and the GM will handle the rest.</p>
<p><strong>When you attempt something risky</strong>, sum <code>2d6</code> and add one of your skill modifiers, based on the action you’re taking. (The GM will tell you some of the possible consequences before you roll, so you can decide if it’s worth the risk or if you want to revise your action).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2(snake eyes) is a critical failure</strong>: shit hits the fan.</li>
<li><strong>3-6 is a miss</strong>: things don’t go well and the risk turns out badly.</li>
<li><strong>7-9 is a partial success</strong>: you do it but at a cost, compromise, retribution, retaliation, harm, etc.</li>
<li><strong>10-11 is a full success</strong>: you do it without complications.</li>
<li><strong>12 (boxcars) is a critical success</strong>: you do it perfectly to some extra benefit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>A miss or a partial success might incur an enemy attack; damage; an additional threat; a lost item/resource/opportunity; a disadvantage; an unwelcome truth. They add to the role-play and can amp up the tension in a scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="dieoffate">Die of Fate</h4>
<p><strong>Sometimes the GM will roll the <code>die of fate</code> to see how a situation unfolds</strong>. Low numbers are ill-fortune; high numbers are good fortune. The die of fate might be rolled to establish the weather, indicate a random NPC’s general attitude, to determine if a wandering monster appears, or the moral of a monster. The GM may also roll the die of fate if the PCs take some action for which sheer chance is the only factor in the outcome. <strong>You will roll this often!</strong></p>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="gear">Gear</h3>
<p><strong>You have <code>12+con</code> inventory slots</strong>. Items you can hold in one hand take one slot; items that might require two hands to hold take two slots. One slot examples: worn armor/clothes (two slots if carried); a few daggers; a bag containing 250 coins. Two slot examples: martial/great weapons; large shields; animal trap; wine casks. When carrying more items than you have slots, you are <code>encumbered</code> (disadvantage on rolls involving physicality).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Inventory slots are meant to be more <em>concept than rule</em>. The intent is to remind players of the <em>useful</em> items their PCs are carrying, while providing a reasonable amount they are <em>able</em> to carry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>You start with <code>2d6*10</code> silver coins…</strong></p>

<p><strong>B&B</strong> uses <strong>Milestones</strong> to measure a player character's development. The GM sets a goal(s) for the PCs to accomplish before they can reach the next level. Each level should be twice as hard to achieve (give or take). Milestones might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>merely surviving their first encounter</li>
<li>obtaining a MacGuffin</li>
<li>completing a quest</li>
<li>defeating a boss</li>
<li>failures… always a formidable teacher</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lastbreath">Last Breath</h3>
<p>When a PC's <code>HP</code> drops to 0, they must roll <code>2d6+con</code>:</p>
<p>On a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6-</strong>: you're dead; roll a new character :rip:</li>
<li><strong>7-9:</strong> you will meet <strong>Death</strong> and bargain for your life. SPOILER: <em>Death can be a dick!</em></li>
<li><strong>10+:</strong> you feel like hammered shit… but you're alive</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="truenames">True Names</h3>
<p>True names have power; knowing a true name gives you power over <em>the named</em>. Calling to someone by their <code>True Name</code> gives them advantage on <code>Last Breath</code> rolls.</p>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="gms">GMs</h3>
<p>The following are friendly suggestions for GMing <strong>B&B</strong>. As always, do what's right for you or your players.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initiative:</strong> The coolest part of <code>Initiative</code>… is saying <strong>roll initiative!</strong> Given a group of reasonable size (2-5 PCs), <em>cinematic jump cuts</em> (camera-like jumps between players/situations; that follow the narrative) are a great alternative. It also works well with a split party.</li>
<li><strong>Splitting the Party:</strong> ALWAYS split the party. It's a hoot.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Encounters:</strong> Don't do it! PCs should be smart enough to know when they're outmatched. If not, there's always <code>Last Breath</code>. Outside of that, rolling new characters is a snap in <strong>B&B</strong> :)</li>
<li><strong>Magic Items:</strong> resist issuing +1 <em>to hit</em> items; rather give +1 to damage or something more situational</li>
</ul>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>v 1.3</em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a>, <code>Skills and Special Abilities</code> help define a character's class. They map directly to the classic classes: <strong>Cleric, Fighter, Mage, Ranger & Thief</strong>; but they can also be bent to accommodate custom classes… like <a href="assets/images/chars/benedict_sandaries.pdf">Alchemist</a> or <a href="assets/images/chars/black_jenny.pdf">Road Agent</a>. The following details how these rules have evolved in my games.</p>
<p><break></p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>When a PC attempts something in the fiction that might be covered by a skill (eg. Athletics when climbing) they can roll <em>advantage</em> (<code>3d6</code> &amp; keep the highest 2) <code>+ mod</code> instead of a regular roll.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Athletics:</strong> <code>+str/dex</code>: feats of strength and dexterity</li>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: perceiving the environment around you</li>
<li><strong>Deception:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: attempt to deceive</li>
<li><strong>Decipher:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: discern a thing; attempt to understand or interpret</li>
<li><strong>Heal:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: provide an extra <code>hd</code> to the party when resting/rolling <code>hp</code>; heal <code>1d6+level hp</code> with your touch.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: use leverage to influence someone; diplomacy; intimidate; parley</li>
<li><strong>Lore:</strong> <code>+int</code>: consult your accumulated knowledge about something</li>
<li><strong>Stealth:</strong> <code>+dex</code>: attempt to be sneaky</li>
<li><strong>Survival:</strong> <code>+con</code>: foraging, hunting; start a fire in unfavorable conditions, etc</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specialabilities">Special Abilities</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>These abilities can add additional flavor to a class. The word <code>attempt</code> will generally signify rolling a <code>2d6+mod</code> when applicable.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backstab:</strong> +3 damage from concealment</li>
<li><strong>Bless:</strong> anoint items with holy water for +/-3 damage and as magical</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=cantrip">Cantrips</a>:</strong> cast 3 simple magical spells</li>
<li><strong>Command:</strong> attempt to command any spirit, demon, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Cure:</strong> attempt to neutralize poisons or remove curses</li>
<li><strong>Hardy:</strong> +6 hp</li>
<li><strong>Lucky:</strong> turn a miss into a partial success once per day</li>
<li><strong>Pet:</strong> you have a loyal and <em>effective</em> animal companion</li>
<li><strong>Reflexes:</strong> you always act first and cannot be surprised</li>
<li><strong>Ritual:</strong> attempt occult rituals; detailed in ancient tomes and scrolls</li>
<li><strong>Scout:</strong> with you on point, your party can move quicker, cover more ground and spot targets before they spot you</li>
<li><strong>Skirmish:</strong> +1 damage; worn armor counts as one type lighter</li>
<li><strong>Slay:</strong> +2 melee damage</li>
<li><strong>Summon:</strong> summon a spirit you know by its true name</li>
<li><strong>Tinker:</strong> pick a lock, pocket or trap w/ tools</li>
<li><strong>Tough:</strong> +1 armor</li>
<li><strong>Turn:</strong> attempt to hold undead at bay with your faith and holy symbol</li>
<li><strong>Vision:</strong> commune with your deity or demon via holy water/drugs</li>
<li><strong>Volley:</strong> +2 ranged damage</li>
<li><strong>Wild:</strong> converse with and attempt to command animals; some classes (eg. Druids) use this to <em>shapeshift</em></li>
</ul>]]></description>

    <title>Black Jenny and her Gang of Miscreant Sons</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=black_jenny_and_her_gang_of_miscreant_sons</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=black_jenny_and_her_gang_of_miscreant_sons</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I like to weave pre-written modules into my campaigns (parts of them, anyway). The different tones and ideas keep my players guessing and oftentimes end up becoming part of our lore. Case in point: when I threw <a href="http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2012/08/prison-of-hated-pretender-pdf.html">Prison of the Hated Pretender</a> into my longrunning campaign. I had previously run it as a one-shot when one of my players was unavailable. It ended in a TPK 🙄.</p>
<p><break></p>
<p>Being the benevolent GM that I am, I decided to bring my campaign party back to this setting and witness their one-shot character's dead, broken bodies. They also found out that the Pretender… HAS ESCAPED! In search of his crown, he immediately sought out… <em>Black Jenny</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Hated Pretender and Black Jenny are now NPCs in my world.</strong> From the module, we know Jenny's name; the name of her gang, and that she stole the crown of the Hated Pretender. Thus, I had to flesh her out a bit. This is what I came up with…</p>
<h3 id="thegang">The Gang</h3>
<p>Jenny's "sons" are neither boys nor related to her by blood. Street urchins with promise; she recruits them, trains them and puts them to work. All mentions of her <em>Miscreant Sons</em> are met with a collective groan from the girls. It is safer to pose as <em>sons than daughters</em>; so they look the other way… <em>but hate it</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Jenny</strong> - <em>road agent</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd5(+2con); ac+2; at2d6(+2dex/0str): 2d6(+1 daggers)</code></p>
  <p>She has dark hair and black leather armor. A string of onyx gemstones around her neck. She wants to retire… in a <em>black tower</em>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Natty</strong> - <em>thief</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd3; ac0; at1d6(+2dex/0str): 1d6(bow +1/daggers); lock picks/backstab;</code></p>
  <p>The oldest of the girls at 14, it's getting more and more difficult to play the role of a "son". She wears her long, red hair in a <em>boys style</em>; frumpy clothes and is quick to pick a pocket.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Lunara</strong> - <em>alchemist</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd3; ac0; at1d6: 1d6(+1 pistols/darts); ritual/lore</code></p>
  <p>She sports a blonde bowl cut and a tunic with multiple burn marks. Through rituals, she is able to concoct healing potions, gunpowder and an <em>exploding</em> paralysis potion. She wears a leather satchel full of glass vials.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Peregrine</strong> - <em>ranger</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd3(+2con); ac0; at1d6(+1str): bite/claws;</code></p>
  <p>She is a <em>skin-walker</em> and can shapeshift into a falcon. She has a number of tattoos and spiked, dark hair. She always attacks in falcon form.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
<p>The gang will attempt to get an edge by having <strong>Peregrine</strong> drop a paralysis vial on targets. Those that remain moving will get the same potion via a dart from <strong>Lunara</strong>. Otherwise, they will turn to <strong>Natty's</strong> stealth or ability to <em>obtain</em> things…</p>]]></description>

    <title>A Magic System</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_magic_system</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_magic_system</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>v 1.6</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The door to magic is closed for most; some few may find it ajar; <em>fewer still</em> may pick the door's lock altogether. Aptitude for the craft is is not unusual but is often misinterpreted. Great magic requires <em>constant practice</em>. The best magi are not always the most gifted; just <em>persistent</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Magic is dangerous</strong>; spells go poorly and the consequences can be… severe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><break></p>
<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>
<p><strong>You can master spells equal to your level + 2</strong> (eg. 1st level magi have mastered 3 spells).</p>
<p>Casting spells takes a physical toll. <strong>You can safely cast spells equal to your <code>hd + con</code></strong> (ie. <em>spell slots</em>). Above that, you take <code>1d6+lvl</code> damage for each spell cast. Safe casting is restored after resting in <em>comfort and safety</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Mages add <code>int</code> to their casting rolls; clerics add <code>wis</code></strong> (eg. <code>2d6+int/wis</code>) and your <code>level</code> to damage rolls (eg. <code>2d6+lvl</code>). You gain an extra <code>d6</code> of damage at levels 5 &amp; 10.</p>
<p>When you level up, you may swap mastered spells for new ones.</p>
<h3 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h3>
<p><strong>You may attempt to cast spells from written texts</strong>. This requires more casting time while you read/review the spell (ie. <em>a turn</em>) and expends a <em>spell slot</em>.</p>
<p>It is wise to identify a spell before casting it!</p>
<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
<p><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=enhancement"><em>Enhancement</em> spells</a> are cast in conjunction with a target spell. They augment spell casting and/or effect, and expend a <em>spell slot</em> in addition to the target spell.</p>
<h3 id="mishaps">Mishaps</h3>
<p><strong>Magic is dangerous</strong>. A failed casting roll may have consequences; a critical fail always will.</p>
<p>An example mishap table:</p>
<ol>
<li>the target reflects the spell back at caster</li>
<li>1d6 damage to the caster</li>
<li>the caster is blinded/frozen/afraid/etc… for a short time</li>
<li>the spell affects the party in some way (depending on the spell)</li>
<li>the caster turns blue</li>
<li>nothing happens… <em>lucky</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="addendum">Addendum</h3>
<p>Presented as an alternate/additional magic system for <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a>.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="/#spells">growing list of spells</a> and/or allow players to create their own.</p>]]></description>

<p>This is a one-ish shot that I wrote for the <a href="https://www.dungeoncontest.com/opdc-2020">2020 One Page Dungeon Contest</a> and slipped it into our campaign (so sneaky). It's called <a href="https://brine.dev/#post?s=one_page_dungeon_contest">a Debt for the Dead</a>. It turned out to be a ton of fun, and <em>marked</em> the entire campaign FOREVAH! Looking at it today, I can see why it wasn't well received by the judges :) I really hate doing <em>print work</em> and it shows. Still… fun stuff!</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I like <em>one page dungeons</em>. My current campaign started with <a href="https://dndeed.tumblr.com/post/145693588517/tower-of-the-time-wizard-my-penultimate-winning">Andrew Harshman's</a> one pager… and it sparked almost a year of play so far. One page dungeons are great for one-shots, drop in locations or even just a source to steal from.</p>
<p><break></p>
<p>So when the 2020 contest came up, I decided to write my own. I <em>thoroughly</em> play tested it… <em>once</em>… but it ended up being really fun (isn't it always fun to kill your players' characters?) and it now too, plays a large part in my current campaign.</p>
<p>Anyway, here 'tis… let me know if you end up running it!</p>
