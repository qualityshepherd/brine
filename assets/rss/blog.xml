    <title>2023 - A Gaming Year in Review</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=2023_a_gaming_year_in_review</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=2023_a_gaming_year_in_review</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>With 2023 in the rear-view, I began to reflect on the year from a gaming perspective. It turns out there are a number of things worthy of a shout-out!</p>
<h3 id="1playinggames">1. Playing Games</h3>
<p>I am a forever GM. I have run way more games than I've played. In 2023 that changed and I found myself playing a LOT more. It really opened my mind to various games and play-styles, and helped hone what I want in a game. This was definitely the biggest revelation and the reason for the rest of the list. If I was going to list a new year's resolution, it would have to be to just play more games. Here's hoping!</p>
<h3 id="2newgames">2. New Games</h3>
<p>The <del>game</del> toolset of the year for me was <a href="https://wightbred.itch.io/named-toolkit">Named</a>. I'm a big fan of playing into a character and thus, I gravitate towards tag-based character builds. Named uses epithets called--strangely enough--<code>Names</code>. While similar to tags, for my money, they add more juice. I see them as things people call your character… or whisper behind their back. This is a small but important distinction; YMMV.</p>
<p>More interesting still is how Named handles advancement through <code>Reflections</code>. At the end of a session, the table talks about what each character did in the game. Did they earn a new Name? Did a name not fit or need changing? It's easily the best advancement system I've ever seen… and now it's mine; MINE! :D</p>
<p>I was fortunate to get the full hat-trick with Named. I played it, <a href="https://playworldspodcast.com/#tags?t=skypirates-of-jotnaar">podcasted it</a> and contributed to a setting for it: <a href="https://wightbred.itch.io/skypirates-of-jotnaar">Skypirates of Jotnaar</a> (that is REALLY cool if I do say so myself).</p>
<p>Honorable mention for Dr. Paul's <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/paul-jennings-and-kitty-hiraeth/palaeolithic-voyages/paperback/product-kpmy8y.html">Palaeolithic Voyages</a>. You can keep your +1 swords; just gimme a good rock and some flint! I really wanna play more of this system.</p>
<h3 id="3newgenre">3. New Genre</h3>
<p>I played my first game of Delta Green. For whatever reason, I'm not drawn to Cthulhu games but I  dig Delta Green. It comes down to the twist: characters are not trying to solve a mystery; they are trying to stop/contain/suppress/clean up a problem. More MIB or X-Files than straight Lovecraftian cosmic horror. Really fun game.</p>
<p>I look forward to reflecting on 2024!</p>]]></description>

    <title>A Magic System</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_magic_system</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_magic_system</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>v 1.6</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The door to magic is closed for most; some few may find it ajar; <em>fewer still</em> may pick the door's lock altogether. Aptitude for the craft is is not unusual but is often misinterpreted. Great magic requires <em>constant practice</em>. The best magi are not always the most gifted; just <em>persistent</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Magic is dangerous</strong>; spells go poorly and the consequences can be… severe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><break></p>
<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>
<p><strong>You can master spells equal to your level + 2</strong> (eg. 1st level magi have mastered 3 spells).</p>
<p>Casting spells takes a physical toll. <strong>You can safely cast spells equal to your <code>hd + con</code></strong> (ie. <em>spell slots</em>). Above that, you take <code>1d6+lvl</code> damage for each spell cast. Safe casting is restored after resting in <em>comfort and safety</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Mages add <code>int</code> to their casting rolls; clerics add <code>wis</code></strong> (eg. <code>2d6+int/wis</code>) and your <code>level</code> to damage rolls (eg. <code>2d6+lvl</code>). You gain an extra <code>d6</code> of damage at levels 5 &amp; 10.</p>
<p>When you level up, you may swap mastered spells for new ones.</p>
<h3 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h3>
<p><strong>You may attempt to cast spells from written texts</strong>. This requires more casting time while you read/review the spell (ie. <em>a turn</em>) and expends a <em>spell slot</em>.</p>
<p>It is wise to identify a spell before casting it!</p>
<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
<p><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=enhancement"><em>Enhancement</em> spells</a> are cast in conjunction with a target spell. They augment spell casting and/or effect, and expend a <em>spell slot</em> in addition to the target spell.</p>
<h3 id="mishaps">Mishaps</h3>
<p><strong>Magic is dangerous</strong>. A failed casting roll may have consequences; a critical fail always will.</p>
<p>An example mishap table:</p>
<ol>
<li>the target reflects the spell back at caster</li>
<li>1d6 damage to the caster</li>
<li>the caster is blinded/frozen/afraid/etc… for a short time</li>
<li>the spell affects the party in some way (depending on the spell)</li>
<li>the caster turns blue</li>
<li>nothing happens… <em>lucky</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="addendum">Addendum</h3>
<p>Presented as an alternate/additional magic system for <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a>.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="/#spells">growing list of spells</a> and/or allow players to create their own.</p>]]></description>

    <title>A TTRPG Manifesto</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_ttrpg_manifesto</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=a_ttrpg_manifesto</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We are exploring different approaches to TTRPGs. Through play we have come to value:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shared understanding of a world over rules</li>
<li>Table trust over systems</li>
<li>Immersion over character sheets</li>
<li>Conversation and negotiation over procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, while there is value in the elements on the right, we value the elements on the left more.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Accidental FKR</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=accidental_fkr</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=accidental_fkr</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>My game has been unintentionally <em>molting</em> toward <strong>FKR</strong>. It started before ever hearing the term. It just kinda happened and I continue to enjoy its inherent permission for further mutations.</p>
<p>During a hiatus from D&amp;D 5E, I found myself reading other game systems; exploring their rules (or lack thereof) and ideas. Honestly, I hadn't put together that I wanted to run another system. I was just being curious. Bits and pieces of various systems started to click; most notably, <a href="https://dungeon-world.com">Dungeon World</a>.</p>
<p>Hilariously, I've never run Dungeon World; nor do I have interest in doing so. I don't find it to be a particularly compelling game, but rather a fantastic GM reference! Just reading it changed the way I run games. It also illuminated my want of a different ruleset: something simpler; more inclusive. I didn't need to look very far (even if I did)… DW lead me right to <a href="https://johnharper.itch.io/world-of-dungeons">World of Dungeons (WoDu)</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of things in WoDu that changed my game forever (<code>2d6</code> &amp; <code>Die of Fate</code> come to mind) but in terms of FKR, it was <em>the holes</em>. <em>What do these Skills do? How do rituals work? Decipher?</em> The old GM in me would have thought: <em>"okay, I need to figure out all this shit before we play"</em>. But thanks to my exploration of other rulesets, I was able to give myself permission to put these questions to <em>my group</em>. My players really took to this inclusive approach to rule creation. It's very likely why we've been playing for so long (going on 3 years)! Lighter rules also lead to less character sheet-gazing and more creativity. I was hooked!</p>
<p>Two years later, I published some of these <em>house rules</em> as <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/beasts-barrows">Beasts & Barrows</a>. But shortly thereafter, even BnB started feeling heavy to me. So with an inspiring nudge from <a href="https://jasontocci.itch.io/2400">2400</a>, I took another step and revamped them into their new, unfinished form: <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/1420-bnb">1420 Beasts & Barrows</a>. The most notable differences being the lack of stats and d6 dice pool skills. This new ruleset is currently peculating with my regular crew.</p>
<p>For the record, I have no desire to debate what is/isn't FKR. I am not an authority; nor do I wish to be. I purposely refrained from explaining it or linking it to anything here. I prefer its definition to remain elusive and open. I find my game jives with the idea of FKR more than other rpg philosophies (for lack of a better term). YMMV.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Beasts &amp; Barrows</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=beasts_and_barrows</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=beasts_and_barrows</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="https://brine.dev">brine</a> - <version><em>v 1.0</em></version></p>
<p><strong>Beasts & Barrows</strong> is an uncomplicated fantasy role-playing game (RPG) for 2-5 players + Game Maestro (GM). It steals blatantly from John Harper's <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a> and shares the same <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta">PbtA</a> core mechanic (<code>2d6</code>). <del>YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO HACK THIS!</del></p>
<p><strong>Beasts & Barrows (B&B)</strong> values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>role-play:</strong> rules and mechanics emphasize and encourage role-play</li>
<li><strong>simplicity:</strong> less math; less rules; more fun</li>
<li><strong>show, don't tell:</strong> don't <em>tell</em> me your alignment… <em>show</em> me your alignment; don't <em>tell</em> me you attack; <em>describe</em> your attack</li>
<li><strong>flexibility:</strong> running existing adventures from <em>any</em> system is trivial</li>
</ul>
<p><break></p>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="charactercreation">Character Creation</h3>
<p><strong>What kind of character sounds fun to play?</strong> Rolling a new character takes <em>ones of minutes</em>. This question will likely take the longest to answer. Here are some classic examples but you are free to create your own:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior:</strong> strong and good with the stabby stab</li>
<li><strong>Thief:</strong> nimble and sneaky sneaksters</li>
<li><strong>Mage:</strong> smart and full of arcaney goodness</li>
<li><strong>Priest:</strong> wise and has a direct line to the gods</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Outside of the <em>classic classes</em>, players are encouraged to create their own by making clever use of the existing <code>Skills and Abilities</code>. For example an <strong>Alchemist</strong> might require <code>Lore</code> and create their potions via <code>Rituals</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What race is your character?</strong> Human? Elf? Orc? While there are no statistical bonuses for race, they can add flavor to a character through role-play.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>exception that proves the rule</em>: GMs may allow PCs to have <code>darkvision</code> or an additional <code>language</code>, provided the player offers sound reasoning to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What <code>Attributes</code> does your character have?</strong> Roll <code>2d6</code> for each of the following six character <code>Attributes</code> and assign the results in any order you wish.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>strength (<code>str</code>):</strong> for melee attacks; climbing; lifting</li>
<li><strong>dexterity (<code>dex</code>):</strong> for ranged attacks; stealth; dodging</li>
<li><strong>intelligence (<code>int</code>):</strong> for casting mage spells; memory; deduction</li>
<li><strong>wisdom (<code>wis</code>):</strong> for casting cleric spells; perception; searching</li>
<li><strong>charisma (<code>cha</code>):</strong> for persuasion; deception; intimidation</li>
<li><strong>constitution (<code>con</code>):</strong> for additional HD; physical fortitude; resist poisons;</li>
</ul>
<p>On a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> the value is -1</li>
<li><strong>3-6</strong> the value is 0</li>
<li><strong>7-9</strong> the value is +1</li>
<li><strong>10-11</strong>, the value is +2</li>
<li><strong>12</strong>, the value is +3.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: <strong>B&B</strong> only makes use of <strong>modifiers</strong> (eg. <code>+2</code>); not the number rolled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Choose two <code>Skills</code> and two <code>Abilities</code>:</strong></p>
<h4 id="skills">Skills</h4>
<p>When a PC attempts something in the fiction that might be covered by a skill (eg. Athletics when climbing), they roll <em>advantage</em> (<code>3d6</code> keeping the highest 2) <code>+ mod</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Athletics:</strong> <code>+str/dex</code>: feats of strength and dexterity</li>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: perceiving the environment around you</li>
<li><strong>Deception:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: attempt to deceive</li>
<li><strong>Decipher:</strong> <code>+int</code>: attempt to discern patterns in texts, symbols or numbers</li>
<li><strong>Heal:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: provide an extra <code>Hit Die (HD)</code> to the party when resting/rolling <code>Hit Points (HP)</code>; heal <code>1d6+level HP</code> with your touch.</li>
<li><strong>Lore:</strong> <code>+int</code>: consult your accumulated knowledge about something</li>
<li><strong>Stealth:</strong> <code>+dex</code>: attempt to be sneaky</li>
<li><strong>Survival:</strong> <code>+con/wis</code>: foraging, hunting; start a fire in unfavorable conditions, etc</li>
<li><strong>Sway:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: use leverage to influence someone; diplomacy; intimidate; parley</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="abilities">Abilities</h4>
<p>Add additional flavor to a class. The word <em>attempt</em> will generally signify rolling a <code>2d6+mod</code> when applicable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backstab:</strong> +3 damage from concealment</li>
<li><strong>Bless:</strong> anoint items with holy water for +/-3 damage and as magical</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=cantrip">Cantrips</a>:</strong> cast 3 simple magical spells at will</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://lvh.me:4242/#spells">Cast</a>:</strong> cast level-less magical spells (see <code>Magic</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Connected:</strong> you seem to have an acquaintance in every town</li>
<li><strong>Hardy:</strong> +6 <code>HP</code></li>
<li><strong>Linguist:</strong> you are fluent in all civilized languages</li>
<li><strong>Lucky:</strong> turn a miss into a partial success once per day</li>
<li><strong>Penitent:</strong> when you take damage and embrace the pain, take advantage on your next roll</li>
<li><strong>Pet:</strong> you have a loyal and <em>effective</em> animal companion</li>
<li><strong>Reflexes:</strong> you always act first and cannot be surprised</li>
<li><strong>Ritual:</strong> attempt occult rituals; detailed in ancient tomes and scrolls</li>
<li><strong>Scout:</strong> with you on point, your party covers more ground; you always spot targets before they spot you</li>
<li><strong>Shield:</strong> when you wear no armor or shield, your faith protects you and grants you 2 armor</li>
<li><strong>Shift:</strong> take the shape of an animal whose blood you've tasted (successful <code>con</code> roll to revert)</li>
<li><strong>Skirmish:</strong> +1 damage; worn armor counts as one type lighter</li>
<li><strong>Slay:</strong> +2 melee damage</li>
<li><strong>Tinker:</strong> pick a lock, pocket or trap w/ tools</li>
<li><strong>Tough:</strong> +1 armor</li>
<li><strong>Turn:</strong> attempt to hold undead at bay with your faith and holy symbol</li>
<li><strong>Versed:</strong> you share secret signs, speech and signals with your brethren</li>
<li><strong>Vision:</strong> commune with your deity or demon via holy water/drugs</li>
<li><strong>Volley:</strong> +2 ranged damage</li>
<li><strong>Wild:</strong> converse with and attempt to command animals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can your character take a hit?</strong> You start with 1 Hit Die (<code>d6</code>) + additional hit dice equal to your <code>con</code>. <strong>Roll all your hit dice and keep a number equal to your level</strong> to determine your <code>HP</code>. For example, a 1st level PC with +1 con would roll <code>2d6</code> and keep the higher of the two.</p>
<p>When you rest in <code>comfort and safety</code>, and consume food/drink, you may reroll your <code>HP</code>. This is the amount of damage you can suffer before you take your <code>Last Breath</code>. You add additional hit dice if you: are attended by a healer; rest in a spiritual place.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A player may choose to reroll <code>HP</code> and find their PC now has <em>less</em> <code>HP</code>. We all have bad days. Are they sick? Did they stay up drinking all night?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
<p><strong>You can master spells equal to your level + 2</strong> (eg. 1st level magi have mastered 3 spells).</p>
<p>Casting spells takes a physical toll. <strong>You can safely cast spells equal to your <code>hd + con</code></strong> (ie. <em>spell slots</em>). Above that, you take <code>1d6+lvl</code> damage for each spell cast. Safe casting is restored after resting in <em>comfort and safety</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Mages add <code>int</code> to their casting rolls; clerics add <code>wis</code></strong> (eg. <code>2d6+int/wis</code>) and your <code>level</code> to damage rolls (eg. <code>2d6+lvl</code>). You gain an extra <code>d6</code> of damage at levels 5 &amp; 10.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Each time you level up, you may swap mastered spells for new ones.</p>

  <p>It is wise to identify a spell before casting it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h4>
<p><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=enhancement"><em>Enhancement</em> spells</a> are cast in conjunction with a target spell. They augment spell casting and/or effect, and expend a <em>spell slot</em> in addition to the target spell.</p>
<h4 id="mishaps">Mishaps</h4>
<p><strong>Magic is dangerous</strong>. A failed casting roll may have consequences; a critical fail always will.</p>
<p>An example mishap table:</p>
<ol>
<li>the target reflects the spell back at caster</li>
<li><code>1d6+lvl</code> damage to the caster</li>
<li>the caster is blinded/frozen/afraid/etc… for a short time</li>
<li>the spell affects the party in some way (depending on the spell)</li>
<li>the caster turns blue</li>
<li>nothing happens… <em>lucky you!</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="playingthegame">Playing the Game</h3>
<p><strong>Narrate your character's actions</strong>. Eg. instead of saying: <em>I attack with my sword</em>; say things like: <em>with my sword drawn; stained with the blood and entrails of the orc at my feet; I charge the last remaining orc, smiting it with both hands and all the might left in me</em>… _or something less dramatic :) . Don't _say_ you do a thing; <em>describe</em> how you do a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Not all actions require a roll</strong>. Say what your character does and the GM will handle the rest.</p>
<p><strong>When you attempt something risky</strong>, sum <code>2d6</code> and add one of your skill modifiers, based on the action you’re taking. (The GM will tell you some of the possible consequences before you roll, so you can decide if it’s worth the risk or if you want to revise your action).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2(snake eyes) is a critical failure</strong>: shit hits the fan.</li>
<li><strong>3-6 is a miss</strong>: things don’t go well and the risk turns out badly.</li>
<li><strong>7-9 is a partial success</strong>: you do it but at a cost, compromise, retribution, retaliation, harm, etc.</li>
<li><strong>10-11 is a full success</strong>: you do it without complications.</li>
<li><strong>12 (boxcars) is a critical success</strong>: you do it perfectly to some extra benefit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>A miss or a partial success might incur an enemy attack; damage; an additional threat; a lost item/resource/opportunity; a disadvantage; an unwelcome truth. They add to the role-play and can amp up the tension in a scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="dieoffate">Die of Fate</h4>
<p><strong>Sometimes the GM will roll the <code>die of fate</code> to see how a situation unfolds</strong>. Low numbers are ill-fortune; high numbers are good fortune. The die of fate might be rolled to establish the weather, indicate a random NPC’s general attitude, to determine if a wandering monster appears, or the moral of a monster. The GM may also roll the die of fate if the PCs take some action for which sheer chance is the only factor in the outcome. <strong>You will roll this often!</strong></p>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="gear">Gear</h3>
<p><strong>You have <code>12+con</code> inventory slots</strong>. Items you can hold in one hand take one slot; items that might require two hands to hold take two slots. One slot examples: worn armor/clothes (two slots if carried); a few daggers; a bag containing 250 coins. Two slot examples: martial/great weapons; large shields; animal trap; wine casks. When carrying more items than you have slots, you are <code>encumbered</code> (disadvantage on rolls involving physicality).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Inventory slots are meant to be more <em>concept than rule</em>. The intent is to remind players of the <em>useful</em> items their PCs are carrying, while providing a reasonable amount they are <em>able</em> to carry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>You start with <code>2d6*10</code> silver coins…</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>B&B</strong> uses <strong>Milestones</strong> to measure a player character's development. The GM sets a goal(s) for the PCs to accomplish before they can reach the next level. Each level should be twice as hard to achieve (give or take). Milestones might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>merely surviving their first encounter</li>
<li>obtaining a MacGuffin</li>
<li>completing a quest</li>
<li>defeating a boss</li>
<li>failures… always a formidable teacher</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lastbreath">Last Breath</h3>
<p>When a PC's <code>HP</code> drops to 0, they must roll <code>2d6+con</code>:</p>
<p>On a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6-</strong>: you're dead; roll a new character :rip:</li>
<li><strong>7-9:</strong> you will meet <strong>Death</strong> and bargain for your life. SPOILER: <em>Death can be a dick!</em></li>
<li><strong>10+:</strong> you feel like hammered shit… but you're alive</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="truenames">True Names</h3>
<p>True names have power; knowing a true name gives you power over <em>the named</em>. Calling to someone by their <code>True Name</code> gives them advantage on <code>Last Breath</code> rolls.</p>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h3 id="gms">GMs</h3>
<p>The following are friendly suggestions for GMing <strong>B&B</strong>. As always, do what's right for you or your players.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initiative:</strong> The coolest part of <code>Initiative</code>… is saying <strong>roll initiative!</strong> Given a group of reasonable size (2-5 PCs), <em>cinematic jump cuts</em> (camera-like jumps between players/situations; that follow the narrative) are a great alternative. It also works well with a split party.</li>
<li><strong>Splitting the Party:</strong> ALWAYS split the party. It's a hoot.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Encounters:</strong> Don't do it! PCs should be smart enough to know when they're outmatched. If not, there's always <code>Last Breath</code>. Outside of that, rolling new characters is a snap in <strong>B&B</strong> :)</li>
<li><strong>Magic Items:</strong> resist issuing +1 <em>to hit</em> items; rather give +1 to damage or something more situational</li>

    <title>Black Jenny and her Gang of Miscreant Sons</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=black_jenny_and_her_gang_of_miscreant_sons</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=black_jenny_and_her_gang_of_miscreant_sons</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I like to weave pre-written modules into my campaigns (parts of them, anyway). The different tones and ideas keep my players guessing and oftentimes end up becoming part of our lore. Case in point: when I threw <a href="http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2012/08/prison-of-hated-pretender-pdf.html">Prison of the Hated Pretender</a> into my longrunning campaign. I had previously run it as a one-shot when one of my players was unavailable. It ended in a TPK 🙄.</p>
<p><break></p>
<p>Being the benevolent GM that I am, I decided to bring my campaign party back to this setting and witness their one-shot character's dead, broken bodies. They also found out that the Pretender… HAS ESCAPED! In search of his crown, he immediately sought out… <em>Black Jenny</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Hated Pretender and Black Jenny are now NPCs in my world.</strong> From the module, we know Jenny's name; the name of her gang, and that she stole the crown of the Hated Pretender. Thus, I had to flesh her out a bit. This is what I came up with…</p>
<h3 id="thegang">The Gang</h3>
<p>Jenny's "sons" are neither boys nor related to her by blood. Street urchins with promise; she recruits them, trains them and puts them to work. All mentions of her <em>Miscreant Sons</em> are met with a collective groan from the girls. It is safer to pose as <em>sons than daughters</em>; so they look the other way… <em>but hate it</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Jenny</strong> - <em>road agent</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd5(+2con); ac+2; at2d6(+2dex/0str): 2d6(+1 daggers)</code></p>
  <p>She has dark hair and black leather armor. A string of onyx gemstones around her neck. She wants to retire… in a <em>black tower</em>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Natty</strong> - <em>thief</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd3; ac0; at1d6(+2dex/0str): 1d6(bow +1/daggers); lock picks/backstab;</code></p>
  <p>The oldest of the girls at 14, it's getting more and more difficult to play the role of a "son". She wears her long, red hair in a <em>boys style</em>; frumpy clothes and is quick to pick a pocket.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Lunara</strong> - <em>alchemist</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd3; ac0; at1d6: 1d6(+1 pistols/darts); ritual/lore</code></p>
  <p>She sports a blonde bowl cut and a tunic with multiple burn marks. Through rituals, she is able to concoct healing potions, gunpowder and an <em>exploding</em> paralysis potion. She wears a leather satchel full of glass vials.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Peregrine</strong> - <em>ranger</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>hd3(+2con); ac0; at1d6(+1str): bite/claws;</code></p>
  <p>She is a <em>skin-walker</em> and can shapeshift into a falcon. She has a number of tattoos and spiked, dark hair. She always attacks in falcon form.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
<p>The gang will attempt to get an edge by having <strong>Peregrine</strong> drop a paralysis vial on targets. Those that remain moving will get the same potion via a dart from <strong>Lunara</strong>. Otherwise, they will turn to <strong>Natty's</strong> stealth or ability to <em>obtain</em> things…</p>]]></description>

    <title>D66 Spark Table Generator</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=d66_spark_table_generator</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=d66_spark_table_generator</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing around with <strong>spark tables</strong>; a concept taken from <a href="https://www.bastionland.com">Chris McDowall</a>. The concept is quite simple: given two numbered tables/lists of evocative words, roll on both, and use the words together to spark an idea.</p>
<p>This is lovely… but I wanted to create tables specific to my games/worlds, and was struggling to come up with evocative words. THUS, <strong>a spark table to <em>generate</em> spark tables was born!</strong></p>
<p><break></p>
<h2 id="instructions">INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Roll <code>2d6</code>: the die landing closest to you (real dice) or leftmost (dice bot) is the first digit (<code>10s</code>); the other die is the second digit (<code>1s</code>)</li>
<li>If you roll doubles, roll again and use both results</li>
<li>Use the result(s) to think of a <em>spark word</em></li>
<li>Record each word on a similarly numbered d66 table (or as many as you want)</li>
<li>If stuck, roll for another spark, or re-roll until you spark something</li>
<li>Once you have your own spark tables, roll 2d6 on each and mash the two words together to generate ideas</li>
</ol>
<p><em>HINT: if using the doubles rule (#2), make sure those words are fairly generic as to mash well with others.</em></p>

<p>I like adventure modules. I especially like the newer ones… that are <em>actually</em> modular. Short, open-ended adventures that are trivial to drop into any campaign. Scanable; easy to grok. This is thankfully becoming the norm; fighting against the epic walls-of-text, and endless lore from modules of yore. This is what I want and what <em>I want to write</em>.</p>
<p><break></p>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/delve-of-the-handsome-repeater">Delve of the Handsome Repeater</a> was born. This is my <em>hat</em> tossed into the ring of an ever-growing list of newer adventures.</p>
<p>To be honest: I find dungeons and dungeon crawls boring; mega dungeons <em>mega</em> boring. So it's only fitting that my first published module (more or less) should be a dungeon ¯_(ツ)_/¯. I hoped writing one would open my eyes to the GLORRY THAT IS DUNGEON CRAWLING! Spoiler… it didn't.</p>
<p>Anyway, here it is. It was fun to write and fun to play… I hope others find it enjoyable.</p>]]></description>

    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=dybuk_letters</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>A vengeful dybuk haunts the town that burned her at the stake. She flits unseen among the inhabitants, gleaning their darkest secrets, hidden weaknesses, and prized possessions. Periodically, she possesses unwitting townsfolk, compelling them to deliver letters to visiting adventurers; each a step towards her retribution. The possessed victims, once released, retain no memory of their actions.</p>
<p>She delivers such a letter to the PCs…</p>
<p><i>
The <em>"respected"</em> magistrate, hides a bloody past behind his noble facade. He hoards ill-gotten wealth in a secret chamber beneath his study. The key around his neck opens the door behind the bookcase. Inside lies enough gold for multiple lifetimes and a ledger; evidence of his copious crimes. Leave the ledger on the steps of the town hall; keep the gold for yourselves. Justice and fortune await those with the courage to act.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
A Friend

    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=fkr</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=fkr</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>FKR</strong> (Free Kriegsspiel Roleplaying) is an approach to playing tabletop roleplaying games. Its popular catchphrase, <em>"play worlds not rules"</em> , is as reasonable as any catchphrase. Play requires the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A shared understanding of a world.</li>
<li>A Game Maestro trusted to represent "the world", and adjudicate player actions and their consequences.</li>
<li>One or more players who control a character and play the world set before them.</li>
<li>Play is a conversation. The GM describes a situation; the player describes what their character does. Outcomes are negotiated together and add to the emerging narrative.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Everything else is a preference for accomplishing these requirements. Some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rules</strong> tend to be <em>lite</em> but there is no "correct" amount. Rules should effectively be <em>"invisible"</em> and not hinder play.</li>
<li>Roll <strong>dice</strong> when it makes sense or not at all.</li>
<li>There are no FKR <strong>systems</strong>. Any system <em>might</em> be used in an FKR game. No system; a mashup of multiple systems; a coin flip… this is up to you and your table.</li>

<p>I didn't set out to write a system… I swear. It just <em>happened</em>.</p>
<p>Here's how it goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>run a oneshot to play around with <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a></li>
<li>the players; the system; the characters… they all click and it's fun</li>
<li>a campaign begins!</li>
<li>during your campaign, start hacking bits of the system to the tastes of yourself and your players
<break></li>
<li>players don't like the magic system? <a href="/#post?s=a_magic_system">write your own</a></li>
<li>hack even more stuff in the second year of your campaign</li>
<li>struggle to explain all the hacks to new players</li>
<li>write it all down</li>
<li>fine… I'll publish it 🙄</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> _there's no <code>10. profit</code></p>
<p>Personally, I wish people would publish fewer systems and publish more adventures. But here I am…. publishing a system. But it's funny with systems: they're <em>personal</em>. <strong>Finding a system that suits your style and hacking off the bits that get in the way should be second nature to a GM</strong>. Continue hacking to the point where it requires a new telling of the rules? Congratulations! You're now a publisher.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> plan on writing &amp; publishing adventures. Time will tell what other little distractions I'll encounter along the way.</p>
<p>Stay tuned…</p>]]></description>

    <title>Incarnates</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=incarnates</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=incarnates</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>At any one time, there are exactly 42 Incarnates in the world; give or take 9 months. I suppose it depends if being in the womb is considered <em>in the world</em>. I've been in a womb 100 times; I say it counts.</p>
<p>Birth for an Incarnate--a silly moniker we begrudgingly accept--is really no different than mortal birth: pain and crying. But also love; a lot of it. I've had 100 mothers, most of which loved me. Given time, I can remember many of their names and some of their faces. These memories--or lack thereof--are an indication of their impact upon me or maybe just how long it's been. The past and present can be such a blur.</p>
<p>All of us go mad from time to time. I have; in only my 3rd life. Other times too but madness, like memory, fades.</p>
<p>Work keeps me going and by work I mean whatever idea takes hold in the little brain I currently occupy. Some of this "work" takes multiple lives to complete. I once spent 4 lives just to ensure the marriage of two bloodlines. One of those lost lives was by my own hand but that's a story for another time; perhaps another lifetime.</p>
<p>In truth, death is rarely that interesting. More often it's actually <em>funny</em>; hilarious even. Swapping death stories is a big hit among my brethren and sistren. But birth; now that is a wild fucking ride. See, in the womb, we're like little beacons, calling out to one of our own. With each Incarnate birth, one of us is summoned--for lack of a better word. A nagging feeling <em>insisting</em> you be in a specific location, at a specific time--about nine months. You just… feel it. It can be quite comforting in a way; knowing something with such certainty. You can live 100 lifetimes and not know anything for certain. Sorry, <em>Incarnate humor</em>.</p>
<p>And sometimes, because reasons, the summoned one fails to arrive and little baby Incarnate is on their own. This has happened to me more than once. It sucks. Because until we can talk--and more specifically, perform magic--we are vulnerable.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, on this, on the auspicious occasion of my 100th life, Amara was summoned. I hadn't seen her for a number of lifetimes. She hadn't change a bit--sorry, more Incarnate humor.</p>

    <title>On Magical Magic</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=on_magical_magic</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=on_magical_magic</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>From the memoirs of Rown Varkana - Mage, Council of Six @Yagul Fane…</em></p>
<p>I have no skill with quill or ink, but my wife insists I write. <em>"Who should know of you if you don't?"</em>, she says. <em>"I am a mage on the Council of Six"</em>, I reply! I neglect to tell her I've spent the better part of an hour trying to get this quill to abide my commands and write for me. Alas, and more time still cleaning up the mess. This empty page vexes me.</p>
<p>I suppose the place to start is at the beginning. Fine. What is magic? It's quite simple really: the world is full of magic things and a mage communes with the world. Air, tree, stone, ocean, star; all allies of the mage. With proper knowledge, a mage may petition the world for indulgence; favors if you like. Given their relationship is in good standing, the world is likely to comply.</p>
<p>Magi are born with this gift but it requires development. Some learn spells from tomes and scrolls while others may intuit them. But this development takes time. The Fae, with their long lives, are the most knowledgeable in magic. They enjoy the deepest bonds with the world. If their magic has boundaries, they are unknown to me but with long life comes madness. Pity the mage that must bargain with a Fae; it's like treading on shifting sands.</p>
<p>The world has a mind of its own and so too does magic. One rolls the dice when casting a spell [<code>2d6</code>]. A mage may tip the scales, so to speak, but at a cost. Balance will be restored one way or the other. For example, a mage feeling their spell failing may accept a <code>Burden</code> [represented by a <code>tarot card</code>], and have it succeed instead. The path to satisfying this burden is anyone's guess. A mage can only endure so many [<code>3 max</code>] before they become lost in the world.</p>
<p><code>Promises</code>--the simplest spells--wield significant potential in the hands of a cunning mage. Often dismissed as "cheap tricks," their ephemeral quality leaves no lasting impression on the world. Yet, they signify an unspoken agreement; a remnant from the bond between mage and world.</p>
<p>Advanced spells demand a <code>Totem</code>—a physical representation of the intended outcome. While a totem should ideally resonate with the desired effect, substitutions are possible. Salt is renowned for its ability to ward off malevolent energies. However, alternatives like chalk or even ground coffee may serve adequately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>Enhancement Spells</code>, woven in tandem with a primary spell, can amplify potency, duration, or scope. While they enhance the spell's efficacy, they take time and compound the risks of casting.</p>
<p><code>Rituals</code> are the pinnacle of magical prowess. They yield unparalleled power but demand patience and dedication. Alternatively, one might venture into the perilous realm of Summoning. But bargaining with a Fae comes with great risk and success is far from guaranteed.</p>

    <title>On Vancian Magic</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=on_vancian_magic</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=on_vancian_magic</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>When writing my <a href="#post?s=a_magic_system">magic system</a> for <a href="https://casadeocio.itch.io/beasts-barrows">Beasts & Barrows</a>, I had two goals: keep it simple and <em>somewhat</em> logical. Towards simplicity, I reused the existing game mechanics: <code>2d6</code>, <code>attributes</code> and <code>level</code>. I also considered using Necropraxis' fabulous <a href="https://www.necropraxis.com/2013/11/01/spell-dice">spell dice</a> but simplicity won out.</p>
<p>Making the system logical took a lot more thought.</p>
<p>Several people describe my magic system as <em>Vancian</em> (ie. spells must be prepared daily; have a fixed purpose and finite usage). <strong>I did not set out to make my system specifically <em>non-Vancian</em></strong>. This is good because when I think about it, it really is quite Vancian… but with <em>twists.</em></p>
<p><break></p>
<p>First twist: preparation. It's silly to expect magi to prepare spells every day. It <em>does</em> make sense that spells are learned, practiced and <em>mastered</em>. We see this in Harry Potter; the kids all practicing enunciation and wand flicking. But this leans more toward <em>practice</em> than preparation. It's also logical that magi have a limited number of spells they've <em>mastered</em>. This number increases as their experience increases. <strong>I want players thinking of creative ways to use the spells they have</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Spellbooks</em>. What dolt-of-a-mage cannot memorize a few spells? Must they write them all down in a book? If they're without that book, can they no longer cast a spell? Lame. No. But books <em>are</em> quite useful. <strong>Magi can read and cast <em>unfamiliar</em> spells from scrolls and books</strong>, but it takes more time (a turn). It also incentivizes <em>scroll hunts</em>. Fun!</p>
<p>Which leads us to usage. It's ridiculous that a mage would forget a spell after casting it. Same goes for it vanishing from their spellbook. No. That's crazytown. The twist here is that casting spells takes a physical toll. A mage can safely cast spells, based on their stamina (<code>con</code>), and have it scale with their experience (<code>hd</code>). This could have also been level but I feel like <code>hd</code> is a bit closer to health… same diff. <strong>Cast all the spells you want… but it will eventually hurt</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have <em>spells with a fixed purpose</em>. Spell authors will have a lot to say about this. But a few twists can keep them simple and allow for more creative usage. I love <strong>levelless spells</strong>. I can see an argument that spell level denotes complexity or whatever… but I prefer to let a mage learn whatever spell they like. I also added <a href="#spellTags?t=enhancement">enhancement spells</a>. Spells that enhance a target spell but cost an extra spell slot. This helps keep spells simple and flexible.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Rando - An Imagination Spark Generator</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=rando-an_imagination_spark_generator</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=rando-an_imagination_spark_generator</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I love me some random generators but mine were showing my neglect and kinda all over the place. My friend <a href="https://wightbred.itch.io/">Wightbred</a> turned me onto <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/125685/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Base-Deck">GM's Apprentice Cards</a>, which inspired me to refactor and extend my own generators into a single web app. Thus, <a href="https://rando.brine.dev">Rando</a> was born.</p>
<p>Thanks to feedback from Wightbred and others, I've been able to turn Rando into a surprisingly useful tool. I was able to incorporate all the things I use for my games. I now find myself using it for everything: prep, GM &amp; Player prompts and even prompts to feed ChatGPT. And while I do not <em>solo [new verb]</em> myself, I am told that it works well for Solo Play too.</p>
<p>Give it a spin!</p>

    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=skills_and_special_abilities</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>v 1.3</em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf">World of Dungeons</a>, <code>Skills and Special Abilities</code> help define a character's class. They map directly to the classic classes: <strong>Cleric, Fighter, Mage, Ranger & Thief</strong>; but they can also be bent to accommodate custom classes… like <a href="assets/images/chars/benedict_sandaries.pdf">Alchemist</a> or <a href="assets/images/chars/black_jenny.pdf">Road Agent</a>. The following details how these rules have evolved in my games.</p>
<p><break></p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>When a PC attempts something in the fiction that might be covered by a skill (eg. Athletics when climbing) they can roll <em>advantage</em> (<code>3d6</code> &amp; keep the highest 2) <code>+ mod</code> instead of a regular roll.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Athletics:</strong> <code>+str/dex</code>: feats of strength and dexterity</li>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: perceiving the environment around you</li>
<li><strong>Deception:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: attempt to deceive</li>
<li><strong>Decipher:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: discern a thing; attempt to understand or interpret</li>
<li><strong>Heal:</strong> <code>+wis</code>: provide an extra <code>hd</code> to the party when resting/rolling <code>hp</code>; heal <code>1d6+level hp</code> with your touch.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> <code>+cha</code>: use leverage to influence someone; diplomacy; intimidate; parley</li>
<li><strong>Lore:</strong> <code>+int</code>: consult your accumulated knowledge about something</li>
<li><strong>Stealth:</strong> <code>+dex</code>: attempt to be sneaky</li>
<li><strong>Survival:</strong> <code>+con</code>: foraging, hunting; start a fire in unfavorable conditions, etc</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specialabilities">Special Abilities</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>These abilities can add additional flavor to a class. The word <code>attempt</code> will generally signify rolling a <code>2d6+mod</code> when applicable.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backstab:</strong> +3 damage from concealment</li>
<li><strong>Bless:</strong> anoint items with holy water for +/-3 damage and as magical</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=cantrip">Cantrips</a>:</strong> cast 3 simple magical spells</li>
<li><strong>Command:</strong> attempt to command any spirit, demon, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Cure:</strong> attempt to neutralize poisons or remove curses</li>
<li><strong>Hardy:</strong> +6 hp</li>
<li><strong>Lucky:</strong> turn a miss into a partial success once per day</li>
<li><strong>Pet:</strong> you have a loyal and <em>effective</em> animal companion</li>
<li><strong>Reflexes:</strong> you always act first and cannot be surprised</li>
<li><strong>Ritual:</strong> attempt occult rituals; detailed in ancient tomes and scrolls</li>
<li><strong>Scout:</strong> with you on point, your party can move quicker, cover more ground and spot targets before they spot you</li>
<li><strong>Skirmish:</strong> +1 damage; worn armor counts as one type lighter</li>
<li><strong>Slay:</strong> +2 melee damage</li>
<li><strong>Summon:</strong> summon a spirit you know by its true name</li>
<li><strong>Tinker:</strong> pick a lock, pocket or trap w/ tools</li>
<li><strong>Tough:</strong> +1 armor</li>
<li><strong>Turn:</strong> attempt to hold undead at bay with your faith and holy symbol</li>
<li><strong>Vision:</strong> commune with your deity or demon via holy water/drugs</li>
<li><strong>Volley:</strong> +2 ranged damage</li>
<li><strong>Wild:</strong> converse with and attempt to command animals; some classes (eg. Druids) use this to <em>shapeshift</em></li>

    <title>Southern Coast</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=southern_coast</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=southern_coast</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Southern Coast</strong>, despite its rugged terrain, enjoys a mild climate shaped by soft sea breezes and rolling coastal fog. Passage to the northern kingdoms is best conducted by sea; circumventing the Sorrow Mountains and the West Marshes. This land once served as a sacred druidic sanctuary until the Northern Kings, seeking an isolated location for their most notorious criminals, ordered the construction of a prison—or as they coldly declared, <em>"a place to throw our trash."</em> To contain their prisoners through mystical means, they recruited the celebrated magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane. The crown also funded missionaries, ostensibly to support the prison's operations while attempting to convert the resident druids.</p>
<p>With these foundations of civilization in place, the Southern Coast draws settlers eager to carve out new lives in this frontier.</p>
<h3 id="whatisthis">WHAT IS THIS?</h3>
<p>The Southern Coast is a system-neutral, regional setting designed for sandbox exploration and adventure. Details are intentionally left vague to seamlessly integrate with YOUR campaign. The setting provides enough flavor to spark imagination while remaining flexible enough to use as-is. GMs are encouraged to modify or ignore content to best suit their table.</p>
<h3 id="situations">SITUATIONS</h3>
<ol start="2">
<li>Loggers in the Starwoods have been attacked by a creature they claim is a wendigo. They've sent a desperate plea to the Monastery for aid.</li>
<li>The Crown's Fury, a ship lost in the Battle of Mistwood, was <em>bursting</em> with treasure when it sank. Rumors of a "ghost ship" seen off the coast are well established but a witness swears that it's The Crown's Fury.</li>
<li>A local herbalist seeks brave adventurers to retrieve herbs that grow deep within the West Marshes, promising silver and potent potions as reward. He discreetly supplies the followers of both "The River" <em>and</em> the Lost Druid; knowledge that would please neither party.</li>
<li>An infamous game hunter, and friend to the Northern Kings, will pay handsomely for help finding/tracking/killing a wendigo.</li>
<li>A Duke's son found a treasure map leading to the Isle of Wights and has not been heard from for a week. His last letter mentioned white berries that heal any wound.</li>
<li>A messenger from the Northern Kings needs safe passage to Yagul Fane. They're carrying sensitive documents about the royal funding of both institutions.</li>
<li>Lady Goodknight of the Fae Court demands the return of all fae artifacts; no exceptions. Generous rewards await those who comply.</li>
<li>The Prison of Mon is <em>quietly</em> investigating why their binding runes are weakening. They suspect the Hag Kalg but it's actually the Lost Druid syphoning their power.</li>
<li>A Northern King's bastard hides among the followers of "The River". Royal agents—aka assassins—seek his "safe return".</li>
<li>Maude's bees are dying and Harlan's famous hops are the likely cause. Both businesses are crucial to the Monastery's beer production.</li>
<li>Jailers report Hag Kalg whispering in an unknown language; prisoners in adjacent cells complain about dreams of a dark dragon.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rumors">RUMORS</h3>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Isle of Wights is aptly named. It's overrun with wights looking to add to their number. Nobody comes back from that wretched place.</li>
<li>Some crazy druid up in the mountains has got himself a harem and is performing miracles!</li>
<li>Yagul Fane is built atop an ancient city with unimaginable magical treasures.</li>
<li>Have you ever known purveyors of magic and religion to get along? There's tension between Yagul Fane and the monastery… count on it.</li>
<li>Greever's Lighthouse is full of ghosts. They activate the old light to summon a spectral ship from the depths.</li>
<li>The mountain mists are the breath of dragons who once ruled this place. The Lost Druid says they'll return once their food source is replenished.</li>
<li>Word is the Council of Six in Yagul Fane are trying to unseat the Fae Court; appointing "more cooperative" officials.</li>
<li>Maude's bees make special honey from Moonlight Mushrooms. The Monastery pays triple for those jars; say it helps 'em <em>see clearly</em>.</li>
<li>Fellstead's abbess and Mon's warden are friendly. VERY friendly if you know what I mean…</li>
<li>Watch for runes in the dunes. Nomads call them <em>twilight portals</em>. But careful! You might end up leagues away… or worse.</li>
<li>Some of those 'stones' in the Bone Cairn? Them's dragon eggs! That's why they fidget at night; they're gonna hatch!</li>
</ol>
<p><break></p>
<h3 id="locations">LOCATIONS</h3>
<p><strong>Freemoon Forest</strong> stretches westward along the South Sea and is home of many rare botanicals. Wildflowers scent the air and the wind resonates like a familiar melody. Mortals avoid this "Fae Land" whenever possible; those who cannot are wise to hire a guide to help with any Fae "curiosities". This is especially good advice should you find yourself a defendant in the Fae Court. The court's queen, <strong>Lady Goodknight</strong> (<code>Imperial, Prejudiced, Grandparent</code>), has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to protecting the forest and the secrets of Fae magic.</p>
<p>Stretches of forest lie burned to ash, creating an eerie beauty in the devastation. The pattern of destruction suggests a dragon, though none have been sighted… yet.</p>

<p><strong>Starwoods</strong> An ancient forest nestled along the coast, where tangled briars and gnarled roots clutch the dirt like fingers. A dense canopy diffuses sunlight, casting a mesmerizing play of light and shadow upon the forest floor. Towering behemoths, prized for their unmatched durability, dominate the landscape and fetch a handsome price.</p>
<p>The trees remember the old laws. Axes that strike too deeply turn on their wielders; paths that stray too far vanish without a trace. The forest is ruled by <strong>The Three Sisters</strong> [#1403]: one of ruthless order, one of patient observation, and one lying in wait.</p>
<p>Legend speaks of a guardian of the woods—a creature part beast and part spirit—rumored to possess an insatiable hunger for human flesh.</p>

<h3 id="hexes">HEXES</h3>
<p><strong>0101 Dark Tower</strong>
A shabby stone tower rises from overgrown grass. Its pale stones etched with fading runes, obscured beneath tangled vines. No path leads to its door; windows dark and silent. Even in bright sun, the tower casts no shadow. <strong>Varjo</strong> (<code>Shadow Mage, Hermit, Obsessive</code>), a forgotten mage, now dwells within his tower's <em>shadow</em>, writing a book he believes will make him immortal. He can't abide trespassers; he calls from his dark tower a warning to any who come too close: <em>"you there… do fuck off!"</em></p>
<p><strong>0102 Razor's Edge</strong>: A mountain stream violently slashes a path, waters churning with deadly fury. A single weathered bridge—more rope and rotting planks than structure—spans the 50' chasm. It looks unlikely to bear anything heavier than a whisper.</p>
<p><strong>0103 The Alarum Fields</strong> A hidden valley home to acres of rare orange flowers, known as Alarums. When approached, the blossoms emit a soft, high-pitched sound, calling out potential dangers. The flowers are harvested and dried to create natural alarms. They also make a highly sought-after tea, renowned for its ability to strengthen the drinker’s resolve and sharpen their wits.</p>
<p><strong>0104 Respite Grove</strong> A peaceful grove of tall trees with orange-stained bark. Their leaves cascade continuously, carpeting the ground. The air hums with serene resonance, urging quiet reflection. Resting here accelerates healing 2x.</p>
<p><strong>0105 Shadow Dragon Lair</strong> The entrance is obscured by shifting shadows cast by moonlight mushrooms, which dimly illuminate the cave. The shadows are nearly indistinguishable from the dragon itself.</p>
<p>The Hag Kalg found this dragon dying before her imprisonment in Mon. Nursing it back to health forged an everlasting bond. The two now communicate via shadows, plotting her freedom.</p>
<p><strong>0106 The Scorched Hollow</strong> A barren landscape of blackened trees and ash, where a forest once stood. Charred stumps pierce the lifeless ground, and occasional winds stir ghostly ash patterns. Nothing grows here. Nothing moves. Only silence.</p>
<p><strong>0107 The Ashen Thicket</strong> A fire-ravaged forest of charred, brittle trees standing over grey ash. Beneath the devastation, faint luminescent shoots struggle through the scorched earth. At night, tiny winged fae move between the burned branches, their soft glows hinting at slow, patient restoration.</p>
<p><strong>0108 The Smoldering Path</strong> A fire-scarred track winds through the fae forest, air thick with burnt wood. From the devastation, a white tree erupts overnight—bark smooth as bone. Its trunk curves like a dragon's neck, branches spread like wings, adorned with shimmering silver leaves. A wondrous thing of strange beauty.</p>
<p><strong>0109 Memory Falls</strong> A glittering waterfall spills into a clear pool, its waters tinged with soft, iridescent light. Locals whisper it’s a place where dreams resurface—or memories vanish. Fae keep silent watch from unseen vantages. Those who bathe here emerge changed: some bearing vivid new memories, others vivid new markings and still others, with pieces of themselves gone.</p>
<p><strong>0110 Bridge to Nowhere</strong> A faintly glowing stream winds through grasslands, its waters shimmering with a peculiar light. A worn rope bridge connects the realm of men to the fae forest. Three brothers (<code>Grizzled, Stern, Conflicted</code>) guard the crossing, warning that passage leads to Nowhere—only loss. The youngest, <strong>Tom</strong>, harbors a hidden bond with a forest nymph.</p>
<p><strong>0111 Key Tree</strong> A tree loams over a  river, its gnarled branches heavy with rusted keys. Some hang by frayed ribbons, others grow straight from the bark like iron thorns.</p>
<p>Turn a key in the air, and somewhere, a distant lock clicks—but what opens remains uncertain. Those who take a key return with unsteady hands and hollow eyes. The keys grow heavier with time… and some doors should remain locked.</p>
<p><strong>0112 The Wishing Tide</strong> Where a winding river meets the sea, the estuary shifts with each tide—fresh water curling through salt, channels never the same twice. At low tide, pools glisten across the flats, some deep, some vanishing in moments.</p>
<p>In one, a single iridescent shell turns with the current. Speak a wish aloud, and the water ripples, showing a fleeting glimpse of its fulfillment. But nothing changes. The tide will return, and with it, the promise of the wish—only the sea knows when.</p>
<p><strong>0201 Quiet Holler</strong> A small valley nestled between hills, bisected by a stream flowing south. It is unnaturally quiet here. No birdsong. No wind. Only the feeling of something watching from just beyond sight.</p>
<p><strong>0202 Keelspire</strong> A hermit astronomer (<code>Starstruck, Prophetic, Rambling</code>) has built an observatory from salvaged shipwrecks, improbably perched on a narrow mountain precipice. The upturned keel of a great ship juts skyward, forming the spine of the structure, while rusted hulls and weatherworn timbers cling precariously to the rock. The old iron groans beneath the devastating beauty of the night sky.</p>
<p><strong>0203 Druid's Aviary</strong> On a mountain plateau, an aviary of stone and weathered wood blends seamlessly into the landscape. Rare birds perch—dozens shift between forms, others carry voices from afar. Druidic caretakers tend to them, and are hostile to outsiders.</p>
<p><strong>0204 Dead Messenger</strong> A horse pulls a body toward fresh grass, its foot caught in the stirrup. A young messenger—scarlet hat askew—is dead. A letter with an unbroken wax seal peeks from his bag—addressed to <strong>Uwin</strong>. The old paint horse, Buttercup, grazes nervously, ready to bolt.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The letter reads: "Now that you've gone, it's all rum and sad luck dames. I don't even care if they miss me; I never remember their names. I wonder where you are and find myself whispering your name. They say if you get far enough away, you can always come back home. Meet me at Number 7 and ask for Blind Jane".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>0205 Who Were Those Masked Men</strong> Two masked wrestlers grapple within a 20' circle of salt. Nothing exists beyond their contest. Cross the circle’s edge, and you become part of the match. Break the salt, and <strong>Mërk (yellow skull mask) & Bërg (black bear mask)</strong> will stop immediately, bow to each other, and flee into the wild in separate directions.</p>
<p><strong>0206 Hanging Tree</strong> A massive tree stands alone, no growth within 20 feet of its base. Hundreds of names etch its trunk—all carved by the same hand, some impossibly ancient. A noose dangles from a stout branch. The tree breathes a somber song, like wind through hollow bones. The names <em>appear</em> after each hanging.</p>
<p><strong>0207 The Oak</strong> A massive tree with a concealed door that requires a secret knock to enter. Inside, a subterranean pub pulses with music. A fae string band plays enchanted tunes, while a dozen dancers move to the mesmerizing rhythms. A silent bartender with eyes like deep wells watches on. Time seems irrelevant here.</p>
<p><strong>0208 The Ash King</strong> A scorched forest where ash blankets the ground. At its heart, a strange figure known as the <strong>Ash King</strong> (<code>Self-Appointed Monarch, Alchemist, Irrational Confidence</code>) has built an ample brugh of ash. He flavors a potent wine from the burnt landscape—and insists all visitors drink.</p>
<p><strong>0209 Greever's Lighthouse</strong> stands weather-beaten, like a skeletal finger pointing to the heavens. Constructed by Ned Greever, whose wife, Ida (<code>Jaded Ghost, Lovelorn, Snippy</code>), met her end by jumping to the cliffs below. Since then, the abandoned lighthouse draws "grievers" who choose a similar fate. All who enter feel a heavy, chilling presence and a lingering sorrow.</p>
<p>The fourth floor still holds Ida Greever's bed; her diary hidden beneath. In it, she writes of her true love—the captain of The Crown's Fury. The day she learned his ship was lost in the Battle of Mistwood, she leapt from the tower. Now she and other lost souls light the beacon, calling the ghost ship from the depths.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ida's diary contains a page ripped from a ships log. It reads: <em>"Curse those berries—lost two more men this week. But the silver sleeps safe beneath the Bone Tree. Only the tide knows the way."</em> see [#0412].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the cliff's edge, purple bog orchids fade in an ancient bouquet. Its card reads "My dearest Ida, Your favorite color. I will always love you, Peter".</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ghost</strong> <code>Incorporeal, Obsessed, Tragic</code>—Each bound to this world by unfinished business. Some don't know they're dead. Some do and are very angry about it. <em>Life is wasted on the living.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>0210 Veil's End</strong> A grim stone manse looms over the cove, more fortress than home. Narrow windows pierce thick, moss-covered walls. Below, a hidden dock shelters a silent pirate ship—colors struck. When <strong>Lyra "Queen" Vex</strong> (<code>Blades, Queen's Stitch, Generous</code>) is home, no one asks questions. Her twin daggers strike faster than sight; tap her amulet twice, and time bends—just long enough to kill. Her crew call it <em>the Queen's Stitch.</em> All the right people vouch for her… for now.</p>
<p><strong>0211 Smoked Hamlet</strong>
Charred beams and blackened stones mark where a fishing hamlet once stood. A young noble (<code>Impulsive, Visionary, Flamboyant</code>) bought the land for more wealth than the villagers had ever seen. In the fine print: <em>no sea access</em>. Now, they watch a new manor house rise from <em>their</em> ashes, trapped between scorched earth and an unreachable tide. Some now beg for work; others <em>sharpen knives</em>.</p>
<p><strong>0301 The Fever Downs</strong> Unnaturally warm hills ripple with heat. Rare herbs grow in perfect concentric circles reaching 30', their stems trembling without wind. A traveling healer named <strong>Hergest</strong> (<code>Healer, Old Codger, Opinionated</code>) harvests plants to brew remedies for body and spirit.</p>
<p><strong>0302 Lost Druid's Grove</strong> lies nestled amidst the craggy embrace of the Sorrow Mountains. A weathered stone circle spanning 40' shows signs of countless ceremonies. Thirteen followers maintain sacred rites despite their leader's imprisonment in Mon. They tolerate respectful visitors to the grove but ceremony days are <em>strictly</em> private.</p>
<p>Ancient runes, similar to those binding Mon's prisoners, are carved into the 12' stone base. Anyone with working knowledge of Mon would recognize the cell layout, cut into the monolith stone alter. Complex chalk markings cover the stones and ground between them, redrawn daily in precise 3'-wide patterns. At night, amber light moves between the marks, though its source remains unclear.</p>
<p>At the grove's heart stands an altar stone—6' wide, black as pitch and cold to touch. Thirteen hand-prints are burned deep into its surface, each glowing with a faint amber light.</p>
<p><strong>0303 Nabal's Palisades</strong> Mountains rise like an impenetrable fortress—stone so steep and dense that no living thing could pass. Nothing moves here. Nothing survives. It took its name from the last fool who tried to climb them; his bones a warning to those who would follow.</p>
<p><strong>0304 Stone Teeth</strong> A vertical wall of mountains blocks passage north. No path exists—just raw, smooth stone rising impossibly steep, blocking all approach to the Prison of Mon. Not even goats can find footing here.</p>
<p><strong>0305 Prison of Mon</strong> A fortress carved into the Sorrow Mountains, its walls blend seamlessly into the face of the mountain. Dark, damp cells stretch deep within, each lit by a single torch. Prisoners wear runed chains that bind them to their sentences—even death offers no release. Prisoners that die during their incarceration serve the remainder of their sentence as a Jailer.</p>
<p>The ethereal Jailers were once prisoners themselves. They stand eternal watch in the long entrance hall, attuned to truth. Any deception triggers harsh response.</p>
<p>Yagul Fane maintains the binding runes while Fellstead Monastery provides rotating monks, food, and care. Both receive <em>royal endowments</em> from the northern kings for their service.</p>
<p><strong>STAFF</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warden Cloudcroft</strong> <code>Stern, Respected, Cunning Linguist</code> - Abbes Salvora visits often</li>
<li><strong>Captain Kell</strong> <code>Veteran, Strict, Proud</code></li>
<li>6 workers; 6 human guards; 9 Jailers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTABLE INMATES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jailers</strong> spectral guardians; scorched amber runes cover their ethereal forms, burning brighter with rage; their touch summons painful astral shackles</li>
<li><strong>The Hag Kalg</strong> <code>Fae, Cruel, Patient</code> - whispers to dragon-shaped shadows</li>
<li><strong>The Lost Druid</strong> <code>Prophet, Elegant, Scheming</code> - was once recorded as Elara Moonshadow in Mon's intake documents, though she refuses to acknowledge this name. The guards whisper that she appeared at the prison gates willingly, carrying only a staff made of twisted driftwood and smiling like one who knows a secret.</li>
<li><strong>Gavric the Silent</strong> <code>Assassin, Mute, Watching</code></li>
<li><strong>Lady Vale</strong> <code>Noble, Beautiful, Mad</code> - ate her entire family at a feast</li>
<li><strong>Brother Ash</strong> <code>Monk, Burnt, Faithful</code> - fire cleanses sin</li>
<li><strong>The Twins</strong> <code>Connected, Amplifying, Dangerous</code> - are kept in separate wings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0306 Resin Grove</strong> Trees bleed a luminescent amber resin into carefully placed glass catches—bathing the grove with soft amber light. The resin is of great value to alchemists and night travelers.</p>
<p><strong>0307 Border Lands</strong> Sand and forest mingle uneasily. Fae and Dustfolk are both touched by mysticism but share little else. A massive tree straddles the border, its branches heavy with trinkets from both peoples—silver threads, carved stones, glowing talismans. A single fae and a single nomad stand watch, motionless. Each tracking the other's breath, neither blinking. Replacements come at precise intervals; to falter means surrender.</p>
<p><strong>0308 Hidden Cove</strong> Smooth stones line a sheltered inlet, arranged too precisely to be natural. Grass-covered foothills hide the beach from casual view. A massive rib bone from an ancient kraken rises from the sand, bleached white and larger than a ship's mast.</p>
<p><strong>0310 The Bone Cairn</strong> A massive pile of bones arranged in the shape of a cairn rises from the dunes. If toppled, the bones inexplicably restack themselves at twilight. Some bones shift position even when the cairn stands undisturbed, and locals swear the arrangement changes with the phases of the moon.</p>
<p>At the cairn's base, the sand is always cool to touch despite the desert heat. The bones themselves are sun-bleached but unmarked by weather or age—no one has identified what manner of creatures they came from.</p>
<p><strong>0401 Impossible Peaks</strong> Mountain fangs rip the sky. No path exists; only shear stone.</p>
<p><strong>0402 Lost Druid's Threshold</strong> Tall grass ripples in patterns no wind could shape. Standing stones peek through the green, their edges worn smooth. Something watches from beyond sight.</p>
<p><strong>0403 Mountain's Spine</strong> Sheer rock walls split by a single path—no wider than a goat in many places. Stones feel warm to the touch, despite the altitude.</p>
<p><strong>0404 Stone Spine</strong> Razor-backed ridges thrust toward the sky. Wind screams through its granite teeth. A single vulture circles but there is little to die in a place where nothing can live.</p>
<p><strong>0405 Freemoon Glade</strong> Silver-leafed trees lean in tight circles. Pale flowers pulse with inner light. Shadows move when nothing casts them.</p>
<p><strong>0406 Ruined Shrine</strong> Three weathered stone pillars rise from marshy ground—all that remains of a small temple. Rusted weapons hang from each pillar, swaying in the breeze. A leather pouch lies half-buried nearby.</p>
<p><strong>0407 Aware Wolf</strong> Buzzards circle a half-eaten goat wearing a silver bell (6s). Nearby, a naked slender man with dark curly hair sleeps in a thicket, his body splattered with blood'. <strong>Zander</strong> (<code>Moonstruck, Charming, Haunted</code>) will claim to be searching for a lost dog. His pack only hunts at night. He speaks to a dead friend, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>0408 The Mirage Merchant</strong> A caravan shifts appearance with each encounter—sometimes ornate, sometimes humble. The merchant gives random names and never looks the same twice. He or she sells trinkets claiming magical effects at twilight. The merchant's shape-changing amulet is real but only 1 in 6 of their wares are.</p>
<p><strong>0409 Wrecker's Cove</strong> Jagged rocks tear at passing hulls. Splintered ship timbers litter the shore, tangled with salt-crusted rigging. A young boy perches on a driftwood stump, eyes fixed on the horizon. A copper whistle hangs ready—the signal that draws scavengers to fresh wreckage.</p>
<p><strong>0412 Isle of Wights</strong> White berry bushes grow thick across the island, their milky fruit a tempting prize. The berries grant miraculous healing if eaten within the hour of picking—after that, they turn deadly. Dead birds litter the ground beneath the bushes, their feathers bleached chalk-white, berries still clutched in their beaks.</p>
<p>No undead haunt this isle, despite its name. Pirates spread that tale to protect their buried treasures, though the white-skinned corpses of unwary berry-seekers certainly helped sell the story. The occasional silver coin in the tide only strengthens local beliefs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Treasure Seekers</strong> The Bone Tree stands on the SE shore; a landmark known to mainland fishermen. Twice daily, stone steps emerge from the retreating tide, leading into the depths. Between two massive boulders lies a hidden chest—a prize for those quick enough to beat the returning tide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>0501 The Chime Stones</strong>
A narrow gorge where wind through stone formations creates haunting chimes. Seven engraved stones—each marked with a core emotion rune—rest near an empty indentation. Placing a stone transforms the gorge's resonance, shifting the feel of the landscape—and those within it—with its emotional tone.</p>
<p><strong>0502 Prophet for Profit</strong> A makeshift shrine overlooks the coast where Tulver Witherspoon washed ashore. After being dead for nine minutes, he awoke a changed man; referring to himself as "The River"(<code>Charlatan, Corny, Ambitious</code>) and speaking of divine currents. His growing congregation of 42 followers camps nearby—seventeen wear the silver anchor of true believers. They will fight to the death for him.</p>
<p>The River studied briefly with the druids before charting his own course; a number of their sacred items still stowed safely away. Among his stolen treasures (old habits) is the <strong>Nymph's Tear</strong>, a teardrop gem originally belonging to the Fae Court. He preaches with a navigator's conviction, claiming to chart not just waters, but the courses of fate itself.</p>

<p><strong>0503 Contested Ground</strong> A ritual site where druids and fae negotiate territorial boundaries. Massive stone discs, each carved with intricate treaties, balance on knife-edges. When wind passes, the discs rotate slightly—marking slow, centuries-long agreements about land use, magical rights, and natural boundaries. Some discs are cracked, others pristine—telling the story of past conflicts and current truces.</p>
<p><strong>0504 The Quiet Line</strong> Where fae forest meets grassland, the earth trembles between cultivation and wild magic. Stunted trees cling to earth with desperate roots. Springtime bursts with medicinal herbs and wildflowers; autumn withers everything to ash. Druids and fae battle here not with weapons, but with the very soil itself—neither side winning, the land forever contested.</p>
<p><strong>0505 The Last Glade</strong> A massive stone arch stands at the clearing's center, carved from a single piece of dark stone. No two people describe its carvings the same way—some see druidic runes, others fae symbols, some see nothing at all. Natural stone seats curve at its base. Those who sit and concentrate on a single question might glimpse its truth—though the answer rarely comes in the form expected.</p>
<p><strong>0506 Silent Dancer</strong>
A faint, muffled melody lingers on the air. Closer inspection reveals dozens of footprints circling in the sand, endlessly overwriting themselves. A quiet voice asks, "Care to dance?" Any who reply “yes” (or anything similar) vanish from sight. The music swells—full and clear. A dozen elaborately dressed fae twirl and glide across the sand, celebrating the end of a drought and the birth of a child…</p>
<p><strong>0507 On The Road</strong> A twisting path through the Twilight Sands, caught between mage order, fae whimsy, and the desert's will. No two journeys are the same. Time bends. Paths shift. The road takes what it wants—names, memories, years—but it's still the fastest way. Only those with magical protection or desperate purpose dare cross. Merchants pay enormous fees to fae guides and Yagul mages for safe passage. Talk to any local and they will tell you NOT to take that road. Flip a coin if they will tell you the "safer" path or lead you to highwaymen.</p>

<p><strong>0508 Oath Breakers</strong>
A shallow cave nestles beneath a craggy cliff, thick vines concealing its entrance. Inside, a stone tablet bears the markings of countless broken promises—blood, sweat, and tears etched into weathered stone.</p>
<p>Those who swear an oath within this hollow find the words binding and treacherous. The air tastes of copper and regret. Only those with truly pure intentions may leave untainted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Maidens Three</strong></p>
<p>On the harvest moon's shadowed cusp, the Maidens Three enacted a ritual of unmaking. Not with blade or blow, but with the alchemy of flesh, form, and flame. Gortha carved, Brielle kneaded, and Tuli consumed, transforming their father into something… other. By dawn, he was gone, his domains theirs. But their inheritance is more than land; it is a continuation…</p>
<p><strong>0601 The Bleeding Fields</strong> These fields pulse with a morbid rhythm, constantly decaying and regenerating. Bone fragments erupt from the soil, then dissolve into grey dust. Any creature that dies here is instantly consumed and reshaped.</p>
<p>This is the domain of <strong>Gortha</strong> (<code>Butcher, Merciless, Dismantling</code>), who patrols these lands offering to "improve" visitors with her cleaver. Travelers find their wounds heal with unnatural speed, but each healing leaves a raised, pale scar.</p>
<p><strong>0602 The Proofing Grounds</strong> A landscape of dough-like terrain that rises and falls with breath-like movements. Paths seem solid, then suddenly soften. Structures slump and reshape themselves in an endless cycle.</p>
<p>This is the domain of <strong>Brielle</strong> (<code>Baker, Consume, Creative</code>), who moves through the grounds leaving warm, doughy imprints. Travelers may find figures partially absorbed into the terrain, their voices muffled and desperate. Those who stay too long risk becoming ingredients in a recipe.</p>
<p><strong>0603 Both Ends</strong> A suffocating heat hangs in the air. Everything is a wick—water boils into fire, stone melts into rivers, trees burst into silent conflagrations. The ground heaves in slow, rhythmic waves of combustion.</p>
<p>This is the domain of <strong>Tuli</strong> (<code>Candlestick Maker, Illuminating, Short Fuse</code>), whose presence ignites the very air. Creatures of living flame stalk the landscape, flickering. Each step leaves a trail of smoking, scorched earth.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>0604 The Shattered Altar</strong> The broken remnants of an ancient altar. Shattered pillars—some larger than a man—lie scattered across the ground. At the center, a cracked stone slab is etched with strange markings. At night, <strong>Shadows</strong> (<code>Silent, Dreadful Presence, Corruptive Touch</code>) move across the stones, twisting into monstrous forms.</p>
<p><strong>0605 Mountain Pass</strong> A narrow path slices between towering cliffs—the only route through Freemoon Forest's northern border. Two <strong>Ginger Giants</strong> (<code>Tossers, Snickering, Delightfully Cruel</code>) guard the pass, shoulders broader than the path itself. They demand a toll for crossing: something unique, not coin. Refuse, and boulders fly with impossible precision.</p>
<p><strong>0606 Shadow Walker</strong> A robed woman sits cross-legged in sand, waiting for <em>just the right moment</em>. At any second she might spring up and step into a shadow, walking through a disorienting maze of darkness before emerging elsewhere—though never quite where intended. She might teach this art… <em>but at great cost</em>.</p>
<p><strong>0607 Runes in the Dunes</strong> is a phenomenon that occurs at twilight. As the first light breaks over the horizon, intricate patterns like ancient runes emerge in the shifting sands. These patterns vary in complexity and design, appearing and disappearing with the rhythm of the sunrise. Locals believe these runes hold secrets or messages from the spirits of the desert. Others see them as a natural wonder, a testament to the enigma of the dunes. Regardless, witnessing the Runes in the Dunes is a captivating experience, drawing travelers and curious onlookers alike to behold the artistry of the desert dawn.</p>
<p><strong>0608 Yagul Fane</strong> Two imposing towers—one obsidian black, one alabaster white—mark where legendary magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane made their home. The ground floors bustle with public markets, meeting halls, and apprentice quarters, while upper floors remain strictly warded off for magi-only.</p>
<p>The Council of Six governs with pragmatic efficiency, treating magical research like municipal planning. Magical "emissions" seep into surrounding lands almost accidentally—apprentices track regional transformations with bureaucratic indifference. They do not dictate how the Dustfolk engage with these changes, yet the Dustfolk have embraced them all the same, weaving the land’s shifting magic into their own understanding of the world.</p>
<p>A village of 300 Dustfolk surrounds the towers, their mix of tents and stone buildings testifying to their adaptability. They use minor enchantments as casually as other regions use tools.</p>
<p>The towers' reputation for magical mastery draws scholars from distant lands, but magic here is not spectacular—it's infrastructural, mundane, and quietly transformative.</p>
<p>The Council of Six governs from these towers, with Fellstead's head monk as tie-breaker.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>0609 Tide Markers</strong> Massive driftwood totems, bleached white and carved with strange nautical symbols, stand half-buried in the sand. A path of worn cobblestones leads toward Yagul Fane.</p>
<p><strong>0701 Ebonchain's Caravan</strong>
A shadowy caravan rolls across the land, appearing only to those in true need. No tracks mark its passage. Veiled drivers guide the silent wagons, led by <strong>Lord Ebonchain</strong> (<code>Regal, Gracious, Calculating Gaze</code>). He offers travelers sanctuary—with a catch. <em>"I expect you'll return the favor some day,"</em> he says, invoking a binding fae contract. Decline and the caravan rolls on; accept and…</p>

<p><strong>0702 Mule Variations</strong> A rutted path cuts through barren fields, marked by broken fence posts and bottles impaled on wooden stakes. A rusted plow stands abandoned, its harness ripped violently—as if something immensely strong suddenly broke free. The ground appears freshly tilled, yet nothing grows.</p>
<p>At night, shadowy laborers work the fields—moving in unison to an unheard song. Travelers who watch too long feel an inexplicable urge to join them, their shoulders feeling the weight of the yoke.</p>
<p><strong>0703 Silent Forge</strong> A mute smith works an isolated forge, hammering an anvil without a sound. Weapons forged here never ring when drawn, armor swallows footsteps, and voices fade to a hush. Every tool bears an intricate rune of silence; craftsmen wear thick leather to guard against the forge’s muting power. Those who linger too long gradually lose their voices.</p>
<p>Commissions require payment in:</p>
<ul>
<li>An oath of silence.</li>
<li>A personal item of sound (bell, wind chime, whistle).</li>
<li>Enchanted materials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0704 The Crooked Saint</strong> A shrine tilts against a gnarled tree. Within, a wooden idol contorted in a painful pose. Travelers who leave an offering wake to find an old injury healed—but a new, unfamiliar ache takes its place. The worse the offering, the harsher the trade. A missing finger for a mended leg, a deep scar for a broken tooth.</p>
<p><strong>0705 For Whom The Bell Tolls</strong> A weathered stone tower crumbles at its base, a large bell hanging cracked from its peak. Its toll drifts across the sands, though no hand seems to strike it.</p>
<p>The Dustfolk believe the bell signals the arrival of a wandering ancestor, a spirit guiding the lost. Magi once charted magical currents by its ring; now it speaks only to those who listen.</p>
<p><strong>0706 The Shrine of Brine</strong> A stone basin in the sand, its rim etched with curling fish. Fresh water fills it each dawn, transforming to brine by midday. Pilgrims kneel to wash their hands, pressing damp fingers to their tongues and muttering prayers for safe passage.</p>
<p>A rusted iron key lies beneath the water—visible yet unreachable. Grasping hands pass right through. The <strong>Mad Monk</strong> (<code>Seer, Unending Thirst, Ravings of Truth</code>) stole this key with a parlor trick, and it now hangs around his neck.</p>
<p><strong>0707 The First Stones</strong> A vast stone formation hums with an odd, mechanical rhythm beneath the sands. The Dustfolk believe this is where the first ancestors were shaped, a sacred place where the desert itself first breathed.</p>
<p>They gather here to meditate, their spirits rising and falling with the pulse. The magi call it a natural anomaly, yet their own magic has amplified its rhythm over centuries. The Dustfolk do not resent this—they listen, adapting their rites to what the land has become.</p>
<p><strong>0708 The Saltwood</strong> A salt-crusted forest clings to the coastline, its trees bleached and skeletal from years of sea spray. Some stand stark and lifeless, a ghostly tangle of bark and bone-white limbs. Others endure, their roots twisted deep into the briny earth, drinking from hidden springs.</p>
<p>The Dustfolk avoid this place—too much water too little sky. Magi have mapped strange currents in the air and soil, sensing something ancient woven into the salt and roots.</p>
<p><strong>0801 Stormridge</strong> Mountain slopes lashed by wind and mist. The weather changes without warning—sudden storms, bitter cold. An uneasy path winds through crags, marked by forsaken campfires. A rotting corpse slumps against a tree, in a pool of dried blood. On his person, a finely crafted bow and rune-carved spear.</p>
<p><strong>0802 Vial Cart</strong> A ruined watchtower overlooks a half-buried cart, bleached white by the sun. Empty, numbered vials and a tattered map to the Lost Druid's Grove rest inside. Faint markings on the vials suggest they must be filled in a precise order.</p>
<p><strong>0803 Forever Young</strong> A landscape suspended in childhood's golden light. Trees grow in precise formations from a memory—each branch, each leaf positioned exactly as they were decades ago. Fragments of a child's toy occasionally peek through roots: a wooden soldier, a copper bell. Anyone entering the grove relives a single, vivid childhood memory—true or invented—so powerful it feels more real than their current life (based on a random tarot card). Leaving, they're unsure what was memory and what was illusion.</p>
<p><strong>0805 Classic Traveler</strong> A tall man with a peculiar limp leads two impossibly strong oxen—Jake and Jim—pulling empty carts. <strong>Malfas</strong> (<code>Tall, Observer, Awkward</code>) is an alien in human form and the oxen are mechanical, which only cutting them would reveal. The traveler has 5 marbles that can perform what some would call miracles. He used one to make Jake, Jim and the cart. He needs one to return home. He's looking for work so he can study humans.</p>
<p><strong>0806 The Veil of Ash</strong> A burnt haze engulfs the sands, the residue of an ancient ritual cast by Uma Fane herself. Apprentices toil daily to maintain the spectral barrier, knowing any disruption could release what lies dormant beneath the dunes.</p>
<p>The Dustfolk believe the haze separates the worlds of the living and the dead. Many gather to perform sacred rites, seeking guidance from ancestors. Though the magi insist they never intended it, the Dustfolk have grown attuned to the veil’s presence, sensing its power in ways even Yagul Fane does not fully understand.</p>
<p><strong>0807 Barrow of the Cane</strong> A twelve-foot monolith of rust-colored stone, flecked with silver, rises from a hill of rusty grass. Ancient runes tell the history of <strong>The Cane</strong>, warrior tribes of old. Three weathered stones frame the barrow's entrance. Within, chalky paintings cover the walls—spear-wielding warriors with animal heads fighting monsters and mountain giants. Hand prints of men, women, and children mark the spaces between. Each cubbyhole bears images of these same animal spirits.</p>
<p>The cubbyholes hold bones alongside obsidian arrowheads, an obsidian axe, a silver bear idol (400s), and simple silver jewelry (120s). Several spear poles of exceptional quality remain, one still bearing its razor-sharp obsidian tip. Those who rest in this sacred space find their wounds heal faster.</p>
<p>If disturbed, the ghost of <strong>Zamma</strong> (<code>Shaman, Mute, Protector</code>)—the tribe's last shaman—appears. His bones rest beneath the monolith, just above the chamber ceiling. Though mute, he communicates by pointing to the wall paintings. He will not rest until the bones are returned to their rightful place. The Cane believed weapons were meant for use, but treasure belonged to the tribe. Those who steal (without trade or sacrifice) suffer their curse—flesh turning to rust, spreading from fingers to arm until death claims them.</p>
<p><strong>0902 Mountain Maw</strong> A deep, spiraling chasm where the mountain meets the earth. Trees at its edge twist unnaturally, their roots exposed as if recoiling. The descent is perilous, the air thick with tension, and the silence overwhelming—until a distant scrape, low thud or eerie bellow breaks the stillness. Beast? Echo? Something else?</p>
<p>Scattered around the rim lie skeletons—warped, massive, unrecognizable. Monsters, every one. All slain in battle, yet no sign of what killed them. No human remains. No clear victor.</p>
<p>Few have climbed down. None have reached the bottom. Some call it a wound in the world, others a doorway.</p>
<p><strong>0904 Harlan's Grove</strong> The region's finest hops grow in neat rows across rolling hills. Francis and Catherine Harlan, and their oldest son Dale (<code>Shrewd, Proud</code>), tend their crops with generations of expertise—though their success stems from more than skill alone. A rare mineral in the soil imbues their hops with distinctive flavors—a secret they guard as carefully as their harvests. Six workers tend the rows while monastery wagons collect their weekly barrels.</p>
<p>The Harlans supply most of their crop to Fellstead Monastery's brewery, though Maude's Meadery has always received a share. This year's harvest promises to be exceptional, despite their neighbor's failing hives.</p>
<p><strong>0906 Old Shepherd's Field</strong> Stone foundations peek through tall grass, marking where Bellwick hamlet once stood. Shepherds still use the old stone pens, though Tam (<code>Weathered, Superstitious</code>) insists on proper etiquette when visiting. The ancient well remains reliable, but those who draw water always leave something in return.</p>
<p><strong>0907 Fare Fight</strong> A copper-skinned warrior named <strong>Lunara</strong> (<code>Warrior, Proud, Suffers No Fools</code>) is fighting three armored traders; her broken spear lodged in one traders' shoulder, she now wields daggers. <em>Wandering hands were NOT part of the fare</em>. The traders' wagon is smoking and will soon go up in flames. Within the wagon are 300s of pelts and two casks of fine wine (200s).</p>
<p><strong>0908 Nettle’s Haven</strong> This sprawling coastal compound has grown organically over decades. It began as a simple cottage but now blends herb gardens, meditation spaces, and other dwellings. The commune is a refuge where druids, monks, and wayward souls come together in peace. <strong>Nettle</strong> (<code>Matriarch, Insightful, Without Fear</code>) watches over it all; her sharp mind still guiding despite her fading vision. Her massive black dog, with a single silver eye, keeps a watchful eye on all who enter, wary of those with ill intent.</p>
<p>Work is shared—no one is turned away, but all must contribute. The walls are marked with symbols from both monastic and druidic traditions, a quiet testament to the sanctuary and survival found within.</p>
<p><strong>1001: Unkindness of Ravens:</strong> Jagged peaks with numerous raven nests. One particular nest contains a pair of small, polished stones that reflect light in unique patterns. These are <em>message stones</em>, used to communicate over long distances.</p>
<p><strong>1004 Maude's Meadery</strong> Vibrant wildflowers border a meandering stream, the air sweet with honey and herbs. The southwestern hives are empty now; their bees drawn to Harlan's Grove despite the distance. Those that return seem changed, producing bitter honey before dying. Maude (<code>Herbalist, Worried</code>) studies each fallen bee, unwilling to believe her old friends' hops could be the cause. Her storage barn holds dozens of honey barrels and mead casks, watched over by her foreman Burt (<code>Gruff, Loyal</code>).</p>
<p><strong>1007 Pilgrim's Hollow</strong> A well-worn hollow where travelers pause before the final approach to Fellstead. A simple stone well and wooden shelter stand beside the path. Pilgrims have carved hundreds of prayers into the shelter's beams. Among them: "Lovely Lady Vale please spare us from your feast!"</p>
<p><strong>1009 Grappled Chapel</strong> A dilapidated stone chapel strangled by <strong>Dragon Vine</strong> (<code>Grapple, Razor Sharp, Poison</code>)—their purple flowers oddly beautiful against crumbling walls. Empty crates rot in tangles of razor-sharp stems. The vines shift slightly in a wind that isn't there.</p>
<p><strong>1105 The Frostwake Grotto</strong> A hidden cavern where the mountain's breath turns the air deathly cold. Even in summer, ice clings to the stone, and strange, pale flora thrive in the darkness. The deeper one goes, the more the ice seems… deliberate, as if shaped by unseen hands. In the very heart of the grotto stands a frozen pillar; something large trapped within. Whether it is a preserved guardian, a forgotten king, or something better left undisturbed—no one knows. Nightly harvesters leave behind clear signs: scattered ice fragments and deep cart ruts.</p>
<p><strong>1107 Weeping Grove</strong> Mist clings to a dense stand of weeping trees. Everything drips with sickly-sweet water, even in drought. Rusted tools and broken barrels hint at abandoned collection efforts.</p>
<p><strong>1108 Fellstead Monastery</strong> perches atop weathered cliffs, its honey-colored stone walls and Gothic spires silhouetted against the coastal sky. The monastery is adorned with intricate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of St. Fellstead (patron saint of seekers of knowledge). A trip of goats roams the terraced grounds, while sea caves beneath the brewery serve as naturally cool cellars for their renowned ale.</p>
<p>The monastery boasts a famed library, produces fine milk and cheese from their goats, and brews the best beer in the south—thanks to an annual donation of hops from Harlan's Grove [#0904].</p>
<p>A group of pilgrims has come from the north, placing additional strain on the monastery's resources and tranquility. They claim to seek guidance from St. Fellstead, but their behavior raises suspicions. Their leader, <strong>Father Falen</strong> (<code>Cutthroat, Apathetic</code>), has been seen snooping around the brewmaster’s office, asking unsettling questions about the monastery’s finances, and lingering in the library far too long. Some monks question their piety and wonder what they’re truly after.</p>
<p><strong>RESIDENTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abbess Salvora</strong> <code>Devoted, Respected, Distracted</code> - frequent visits to the Prison of Mon</li>
<li><strong>Prior Cedric</strong> <code>Rugged, Diligent, Insecure</code> - oversees brewing operations</li>
<li><strong>Sister Elara</strong> <code>Fallen Druid, Healer, Know-it-all</code></li>

<li>24 Monks, 6 pilgrims</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1202 The Skyroot Sentinels</strong> Towering, ancient trees grow impossibly tall here, their roots gripping stone as if holding the mountain in place. Legends claim these trees are guardians, awakened only when the land is threatened. Their bark is scarred with old battle wounds, and those who listen closely can hear faint warnings or welcomes, depending on the visitor’s intent.</p>
<p><strong>1203 The Broken Stair</strong> A weathered stone staircase, half-swallowed by trees and moss, climbs partway up the mountainside before vanishing into ruin. No one knows who built it, but the air around it hums with a strange energy. Some believe it once led to a forgotten temple, while others suspect it was abandoned for good reason.</p>
<p><strong>1204 The Black Fangs</strong> Jagged rock formations jut from the treeline like the teeth of some enormous beast. The stone is unnaturally dark, almost obsidian, and warm to the touch. Local hunters avoid the area, muttering about strange figures seen moving between the spires at dusk. Sometimes, a deep, reverberating hum can be heard from within the earth, like the growl of something waiting to rise.</p>
<p><strong>1205 The Hollow Roost</strong> An immense tree clings to the mountainside, its trunk wide enough to house a small dwelling. Inside, the walls are lined with countless empty nests, though no birds have been seen here in generations. Instead, on certain nights, ghostly wings flicker through the air, and the wind carries the sound of distant, echoing caws. Those who sleep beneath the Roost report dreams of flying over endless forests—sometimes pleasant, sometimes nightmarish.</p>
<p><strong>1208 The Leaning Stones</strong> Stone pillars, worn smooth by time, lean at impossible angles. Strange markings spiral up their sides. Even the monastery's goats avoid grazing among them, despite the unusually thick grass.</p>
<p><strong>1302 The Mistwell</strong> A hidden spring high in the forest, perpetually cloaked in mist. Its water is clear but strangely heavy, and those who drink from it report vivid dreams—sometimes prophetic, sometimes terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>1303 The Slumbering Hart</strong> Deep within the trees, where the land begins to rise, lies a clearing bathed in perpetual twilight. At its center rests an enormous stag—its antlers tangled with vines, its breath slow as the turning seasons. The creature does not wake, but its presence is undeniable. Druids and wanderers speak of it in hushed tones, calling it the Slumbering Hart, a guardian of balance. Disturbing it will summon the wrath of the forest itself.</p>
<p><strong>1306 Four Leaf Clover Field</strong> A field of ONLY four leaf clovers… finding a THREE leaf clover brings the bearer luck.</p>
<p><strong>1308 Salted Woods</strong> Gnarled pines grow right to the cliff's edge, their bark white with salt spray. A ship's wheel hangs forgotten in the branches, creaking in the wind. Fishermen leave offerings here—for luck on their next voyage. Fresh fish bones and a knotted red ribbon dangle from the spokes.</p>
<p><strong>1402 Red’s Woods</strong> A winding path snakes through the forest, lined with hundreds of carved trees—each trunk a masterpiece, so lifelike they seem to breathe. At its heart stands a house built without a single nail, every joint seamlessly fitted. <strong>"Red" Dressler</strong> (<code>Tree-wise, Craftsman, Absorbed</code>) allows loggers to work to the south, but no axe may touch the trees of his woods. His face glows when he speaks of his wife and her garden, though few have ever glimpsed her among the trees—for she is a <strong>Dryad</strong> (<code>Ethereal, Elusive, Nurturing</code>). Those who appreciate true craftsmanship and respect the forest may find themselves invited to stay for supper.</p>
<p><strong>1403 Two Trees And Three Sisters</strong> Two towering trees stand out among the many. These are the trees of the Eldest and Middle Sisters—their roots deep, bound to the forest. Not mere landmarks, they are the Sisters' power made flesh, the beating heart of the Starwoods.</p>
<p>The forest here is a labyrinth of tangled wards—shifting paths, serpentine thickets, and roots that coil around trespassers' ankles. Loggers are tolerated but watched, their axes never allowed to stray near sacred bark.</p>
<p>But the Hollow Sister's influence seeps through the soil, her saplings creeping ever closer. The Eldest and Middle whisper to the roots, listening for signs of intrusion, knowing that if their sister ever finds her way back, it may be too late.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Three dryads as old as the Starwoods themselves. Not mere spirits, but the forest's living will. The Eldest and Middle rule with iron certainty, while the Hollow Sister has become something else entirely.</p>
  <p><strong>Eldest Sister</strong> (<code>Hand of Judgement, Ruthless, The Root</code>) Stern and unwavering, she enforces the Starwoods' will with ruthless efficiency. The Hollow Sister is a threat to be eliminated.</p>
  <p><strong>Middle Sister</strong> (<code>Watchful Eye, Composed, Leaves in the Wind</code>) Patient and watchful, she listens before she acts. Where the Eldest strikes, the Middle weighs the cost. She is the wind in the canopy, the feeling of being watched. She fears the Hollow Sister.</p>
  <p><strong>The Hollow Sister</strong> (<code>Open Arms, Curious, The Heart</code>) Her tree’s roots torn from the earth by her own kin [#1505], yet she did not die. She befriended the fae, and her saplings grow strong in the Freemoon Forest. She waits…</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1404 Marked Woods</strong> Massive old-growth pines worth a fortune in lumber. Loggers' marks show which trees to cut, but someone keeps moving them.</p>
<p><strong>1405 Loggers Camp</strong> A rough collection of tents and wooden structures stands in stark contrast to the Starwood's eternal beauty. Axes and saws echo through the trees as loggers harvest the valuable timber. Even the most hardened logger feels the weight of their impact on these old woods, yet the work continues. The druids offer no aid against recent threats—to them, the loggers' presence is the true blight on their forest.</p>
<p>Boss hired a former druid to help navigate these tensions, but her true loyalties remain unclear. The camp's torches burn all night now, and no logger works alone.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Sisters</strong> remain silent; watching. They tolerate the loggers in the hope that their axes might cut down the Hollow Sister’s creeping saplings. They will turn on them the moment their purpose is served.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CREW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreman "Boss" Bartok</strong> <code>Burly, Caring</code> - prioritizes crew safety over quotas</li>
<li><strong>Nyssa "Thumbs" Dunsfold</strong> <code>Fallen Druid, Witty</code> - hired to appease druids</li>
<li><strong>Lena "Sawbones" Thorne</strong> <code>Medic, Gentle</code> - treats wounds physical and spiritual</li>
<li><strong>"Cookie"</strong> <code>One-armed, Terrible cook</code> - lost his arm to "tree-bite"</li>
<li>12 loggers, each marked with protective symbols</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1407 Blackfish Point</strong> A sheltered cove where prized blackfish school. Village fishermen claim the beach; their boats marked with crooked copper nails—wards from the Boat Hag. <strong>"Cheeks" Allnut</strong> (<code>Burly, Swift-Blade, Bear Hands</code>) <em>educates</em> strangers that this is a private beach and that charter fees start at 100s; no haggling.</p>
<p><strong>1408 Fishing Hamlet</strong> A handful of wooden huts cling to the coast, their weathered walls dark with salt spray.</p>
<p>The hut nearest the sea belongs to Pesh (<code>Generous, Paranoid</code>), a fourth-generation fisherman known for his anonymous donations to the monastery. None question how a simple fisherman can afford such charity. Beneath Pesh's hut lies a chest of 10,000 silver coins—salvaged from the pirate wreck in seven midnight diving trips. The weight of his secret is heavier than the chest.</p>
<p>The hamlet folk avoid the nearby Boat Hag [#1506], claiming her presence spoils their catches. Rotten fish regularly appear on her doorstep, though no one admits to leaving them.</p>
<p><strong>1503 Split Oak</strong> A massive oak tree, split by siege engines during the battle, still stands - both halves alive and growing apart. Moss-covered stones from the war machines lie scattered at its base.</p>
<p><strong>1505 The Tree of the Hollow Sister</strong> A massive oak, hollowed from within, its trunk split and blackened by decay. Its fall cursed the land. From here to the sea, trees stand withered, their roots severed, their bark peeling away. Yet, the Hollow Sister lives.</p>
<p><strong>1506 The Boat Hag</strong> An overturned fishing boat serves as dwelling, its weathered hull grown thick with moss and marsh vines. Smoke from strange herbs seeps through the cracks while marsh birds deliver messages in exchange for scraps. Locals leave offerings at her door—they say rotten fish draws darker things away.</p>
<p>Among her treasures is the <strong>Dryad's Whispering Branch</strong>, <em>acquired</em> from the Fae Court. It allows the wielder to communicate with woodland creatures and plants, though using it risks drawing attention from its former owner.</p>
<p><strong>1508 Pirate Shipwreck</strong> lies just off the coast, its remains jutting from the water. Barnacles cling to its splintered boards, broken masts, and rusting cannons. Venomous reef snakes, camouflaged among the coral, hunt in the wreckage.</p>
<p>Among its treasures was a <strong>Sylph Ring</strong>—a pewter band marked with the fae rune for air that summons gentle winds. Carved on a board just above the waterline is "Pesh was here" [#1405].</p>
<p><strong>1601: The Bone-Wind Chimes:</strong> Animal bones hang from dead trees, creating a haunting melody. The song tells the tale of the Battle of Mistwood. Disturb their precise arrangement, and the melody is lost—unsettling the fallen dead.</p>
<p><strong>1602 Mammoth Maw</strong> A hillside splits open, revealing an enormous mammoth half-buried in swamp mud. Its gnarled tusks rise like fallen trees, fur matted and thick with decay.</p>
<p>The ground shifts subtly beneath its massive form, as though the creature still slumbers. The marsh hums with an ancient presence—the air growing dense, sweet with rot and forgotten blood. Some say it died in battle, others that the land itself caught it. Approach, and feel the creature's strange, silent pull.</p>
<p><strong>1603 Old Pete's Boggery</strong> Wooden walkways wind through the marsh, connecting islands of relatively solid ground. <strong>Pete</strong> (<code>Weathered, Honest, Sharp</code>) and his twelve workers harvest peat from carefully managed bogs—fuel that keeps the region's hearths burning. The work is hard, but the marsh provides for those who know its ways.</p>
<p>Nobody knows these wetlands better than Pete and his daughter <strong>Yde</strong> (<code>Tomboy, Yearning, Hopeful</code>). They can name every pool, predict the weather by the reeds' sway, and find paths where others see only mire. Yde guides herb-seekers and the occasional northern merchant, while the purple bog orchids that grow near their operation fetch a fine price—though Pete never picks the ones with silver stems.</p>
<p><strong>1604 Silverline Point</strong> Natural stone piers stretch into deep water where massive silverline bass school. The best fishing spot on the coast—half your catch goes to the marsh folk's community stew pot.</p>
<p><strong>1605 The Last Garden</strong> A small cottage and garden somehow survive amid ash and char. Fresh vegetables still grow in tidy rows, untouched by blight. A scarecrow wearing a copper nail necklace stands watch. Ursula Mayfield (<code>Green-thumb, Aunt, Songbird</code>) tends the garden and shares her turnips with anyone who'll listen to her stories.</p>
<p><strong>1606 Dragon's Message</strong> Scorched trees ooze black sap, their branches stripped bare. Massive claw marks score the cliffs. The Boat Hag's own skiff lies shattered on the rocks, her copper nails scattered in the sand.</p>
<p><strong>1703 Archer's Ridge</strong> Steep cliffs where archers made their stand. Centuries of storms have exposed arrow shafts in the clay - all pointing to a lighthouse foundation that only shows at low tide.</p>

    <title>Vonnegut's 8 Basics of RPG Writing</title>
    <link>https://brine.dev/#post?s=vonneguts_8_basics_of_ttrpg_writing</link>
    <guid>https://brine.dev/#post?s=vonneguts_8_basics_of_ttrpg_writing</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Kurt Vonnegut is my fav author. I've been re-reading all his books including his workshops on writing. It occurred to me that his advice for creative writing was hilariously inline with rpg writing; which makes sense but still; interesting.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.</strong></p>
<p>Be concise and obvious in writing. Maybe don't have umpteen pages of lore or walls of text or a "what is a RPG" section or purple prose or run-on sentences. "Have the guts to cut" (another Kurtism). Anything not necessary for running the game gets the axe; be ruthless! Get the reader into the action asap or risk losing them. Kurt's advice seems also to imply: <em>keep the reader reading</em>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.</strong></p>
<p>As the reader of RPGs is a GM, this is <em>essential</em>, and perhaps better stated as: <em>Give the GM one character they are dying to play</em>. In a broader sense, give the GM <em>things</em> that make them REALLY want to run your shite for their table.</p>
<p>I just sat here for a minute thinking back and yes, it's usually an NPC that sucks me in. My mind immediately goes to Gus L's <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/333389/Prison-of-the-Hated-Pretender">Prison of the Hated Pretender</a>. I wanted to play the Pretender SO bad!</p>
<p><strong>3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.</strong></p>
<p>This is <em>adventure writing 101</em> advice and rock solid. That being said, when I repurposed my old NPC generator into <a href="https://rando.brine.dev">Rando</a>, I ditched the <code>want</code> part. The main reason being: I found myself not using the <code>want</code>. I'm not totally sure why… 🤔 I suppose, given a random NPC generator, I'm not really looking for <code>want</code>? Or at least that's how it played out. In Rando, I went with three epithets ala <a href="https://wightbred.itch.io/named-toolkit">Named</a> for NPCs; which I love (<code>@wightbred</code>, you ruined me for other ways… thus far). But I also use Rando while writing and just add <code>wants</code> that make sense with the other moving pieces.</p>
<p><strong>4. Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to character, I would broaden this to include <em>setting</em> or <em>world</em>. Bake setting into EVERY. THING. In fact, don't bake it in… mash it in there till setting oozes out of every word!</p>
<p>This also implies revisioning but of course you DO revise, yes? Honestly, I revise too much. It's a sickness and slows me down SOOOO much. Like Vonnegut, I am a "Basher": <em>going one sentence at a time, getting it exactly right before they go on to the next one</em>. It's awful. I envy "Swoopers": <em>write a story quickly, higgledy-piggledy, crinkum-crankum, any which way. Then they go over it again painstakingly, fixing everything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Start as close to the end as possible.</strong></p>
<p>This is both part of #1, and good game-running advice: <em>get the PCs in the action asap</em>. I actually suck at this. I've caught myself having my PCs lollygagging around, walking to a door, relating pointless information along the way. DUMB. This is easy to catch in writing tho; especially when play-testing. Don't start them in the town and bate them to the thing… BOOM, you're at the thing!</p>
<p><strong>6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.</strong></p>
<p>I'm guilty of this one too. I mean, I am OUT on adventures that have MONSTER, MONSTER, MONSTER, MONSTER, MONSTER. But I find myself over-correcting sometimes and going a little light on my players. This is also easier to spot in writing/play-testing. To quote Tom Waits: <em>"There's always some killing you've got to do around the farm"</em>… so it goes.</p>
<p><strong>7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.</strong></p>
<p>I struggle with this one. I don't write for <em>one person</em>. Kurt wrote for his sister… to my knowledge I don't write for any specific person. Maybe I do and I don't know it? I def write for <em>me</em>. I'm writing this post for me. I'm forcing myself to really think these through; which for my brain means I need to write them down. Obviously, when writing RPGs, we write for GMs, but that GM is <em>also</em> me.</p>
<p><strong>8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.</strong></p>
<p>This is more classic RPG advice perhaps most famously from Chris McDowall's post <a href="https://www.bastionland.com/2018/07/expose-your-prep.html">Expose Your Prep</a>. But for all I know, Chris stole it from Vonnegut :D</p>]]></description>

    <title>WHO COMES CALLING TONIGHT?</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="song"><div>
torrential rain in Ravencross
washed over Blackthorn Lane
Lucinda got her stockings wet
when she called on Edmund Graves
all along the wrought-iron gate
the shadows scratch and claw
while drops the size of bullets
strike the eaves with wild applause

Who comes calling tonight?

the bells of St. Sebastian
ignore the midnight toll
swallowed whole in darkness
black as buried coal
vestry candles sanctify
unrequited prayers
Reverend Drake stands trembling
gazing down the chancel stairs

Who comes calling tonight?
