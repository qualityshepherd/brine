_From the memoirs of Rown Varkana - Mage, Council of Six @Yagul Fane..._

I have no skill with quill or ink, but my wife insists I write. _"Who should know of you if you don't?"_ she says. _"I am a mage on the Council of Six"_, I reply! I neglect to tell her I've spent the better part of an hour trying to get this quill to abide my commands and write for me. Alas, and more time still cleaning up the mess. This empty page vexes me.

I suppose the place to start is at the beginning. Fine. What is magic? It's quite simple really: the world is full of magic things and a mage communes with the world. Air, tree, stone, ocean, star; all allies of the mage. With proper knowledge, a mage may petition the world for indulgence; favors if you like. Given their relationship is in good standing, the world is likely to comply.

Magi are born with this gift but it requires development. Some learn spells from tomes and scrolls while others may intuit them. But this development takes time. The Fae, with their long lives, are the most knowledgeable in magic. They enjoy the deepest bonds with the world. If their magic has boundaries, they are unknown to me but with long life comes madness. Pity the mage that must bargain with a Fae; it's like treading on shifting sands.

The world has a mind of its own and so too does magic. One rolls the dice when casting a spell [`2d6`]. A mage may tip the scales, so to speak, but at a cost. Balance will be restored one way or the other. For example, a mage feeling their spell failing may accept a `Burden` [represented by a `tarot card`], and have it succeed instead. The path to satisfying this burden is anyone's guess. A mage can only endure so many [`3 max`] before they become lost in the world.

`Promises`--the simplest spells--wield significant potential in the hands of a cunning mage. Often dismissed as "cheap tricks," their ephemeral quality leaves no lasting impression on the world. Yet, they signify an unspoken agreement; a remnant from the bond between mage and world.

Advanced spells demand a `Totem`â€”a physical representation of the intended outcome. While a totem should ideally resonate with the desired effect, substitutions are possible. Salt is renowned for its ability to ward off malevolent energies. However, alternatives like chalk or even ground coffee may serve adequately.

Furthermore, `Enhancement Spells`, woven in tandem with a primary spell, can amplify potency, duration, or scope. While they enhance the spell's efficacy, they take time and compound the risks of casting.

`Rituals` are the pinnacle of magical prowess. They yield unparalleled power but demand patience and dedication. Alternatively, one might venture into the perilous realm of Summoning. But bargaining with a Fae comes with great risk and success is far from guaranteed.
