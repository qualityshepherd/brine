At any one time, there are exactly 42 Incarnates in the world; give or take 9 months. I suppose it depends if being in the womb is considered _in the world_. I've been in a womb 100 times; I say it counts.

Birth for an Incarnate--a silly moniker we begrudgingly accept--is really no different than mortal birth: pain and crying. But also love; a lot of it. I've had 100 mothers, most of which loved me. Given time, I can remember many of their names and some of their faces. These memories--or lack thereof--are an indication of their impact upon me or maybe just how long it's been. The past and present can be such a blur.

All of us go mad from time to time. I have; in only my 3rd life. Other times too but madness, like memory, fades.

Work keeps me going and by work I mean whatever idea takes hold in the little brain I currently occupy. Some of this "work" takes multiple lives to complete. I once spent 4 lives just to ensure the marriage of two bloodlines. One of those lost lives was by my own hand but that's a story for another time; perhaps another lifetime.

In truth, death is rarely that interesting. More often it's actually _funny_; hilarious even. Swapping death stories is a big hit among my brethren and sistren. But birth; now that is a wild fucking ride. See, in the womb, we're like little beacons, calling out to one of our own. With each Incarnate birth, one of us is summoned--for lack of a better word. A nagging feeling _insisting_ you be in a specific location, at a specific time--about nine months. You just... feel it. It can be quite comforting in a way; knowing something with such certainty. You can live 100 lifetimes and not know anything for certain. Sorry, _Incarnate humor_.

And sometimes, because reasons, the summoned one fails to arrive and little baby Incarnate is on their own. This has happened to me more than once. It sucks. Because until we can talk--and more specifically, perform magic--we are vulnerable.

Lucky for me, on this, on the auspicious occasion of my 100th life, Amara was summoned. I hadn't seen her for a number of lifetimes. She hadn't change a bit--sorry, more Incarnate humor.
