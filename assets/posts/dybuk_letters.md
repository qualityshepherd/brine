description: a dybuk sits down to write a letter...

A vengeful dybuk haunts the town that burned her at the stake. She flits unseen among the inhabitants, gleaning their darkest secrets, hidden weaknesses, and prized possessions. Periodically, she possesses unwitting townsfolk, compelling them to deliver letters to visiting adventurers; each a step towards her retribution. The possessed victims, once released, retain no memory of their actions.

She delivers such a letter to the PCs...

<i>
The _"respected"_ magistrate, hides a bloody past behind his noble facade. He hoards ill-gotten wealth in a secret chamber beneath his study. The key around his neck opens the door behind the bookcase. Inside lies enough gold for multiple lifetimes and a ledger; evidence of his copious crimes. Leave the ledger on the steps of the town hall; keep the gold for yourselves. Justice and fortune await those with the courage to act.

Sincerely,<br>
A Friend
