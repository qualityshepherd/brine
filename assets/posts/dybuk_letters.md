A vengeful dybuk haunts the town that burned her at the stake. She flits unseen among the inhabitants, gleaning their darkest secrets, hidden weaknesses, and most prized possessions. Periodically, she possesses unwitting townsfolk, compelling them to deliver letters to visiting adventurers; each a step towards her retribution. The possessed victims, once released, retain no memory of their actions.

She delivers such a letter to the PCs...

<i>
The _"respected"_ magistrate, hides a blood-stained past behind his noble facade. He hoards his ill-gotten wealth in a secret chamber beneath his study. The key he wears around his neck opens a hidden door behind the bookcase. Inside lies enough gold to set you for life and evidence of his crimes. Leave the evidence on the steps of the town hall. Keep the gold for yourselves. Justice and fortune await those with the courage to act.

Sincerely,<br>
A Friend
