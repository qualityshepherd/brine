**FKR** (Free Kriegsspiel Roleplaying) is an approach to playing tabletop roleplaying games. Its popular catchphrase, _"play worlds not rules"_ , is as reasonable as any catchphrase. Play requires the following:

1. A shared understanding of a world.
1. A Game Maestro trusted to represent "the world", and adjudicate player actions and their consequences.
1. One or more players who control a character and play the world set before them.
1. Play is a conversation. The GM describes a situation; the player describes what their character does. Outcomes are negotiated together and add to the emerging narrative.

That's it. Everything else is a preference for accomplishing these requirements. Some considerations:

- **Rules** tend to be _lite_ but there is no "correct" amount. Rules should effectively be _"invisible"_ and not hinder play.
- Roll **dice** when it makes sense or not at all.
- There are no FKR **systems**. Any system _might_ be used in an FKR game. No system; a mashup of multiple systems; a coin flip... this is up to you and your table.
