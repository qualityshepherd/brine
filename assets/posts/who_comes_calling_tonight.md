<i class="center">

torrential rain in Ravencross<br>
washed over Blackthorn Lane<br>
Lucinda got her stockings wet<br>
when she called on Edmund Graves<br>
all along the wrought-iron gate<br>
the shadows creep and crawl<br>
while drops the size of bullets<br>
strike the eaves with wild applause<br>
<br>
Who comes calling tonight?<br>
<br>
the bells of St. Sebastian<br>
ignore the midnight toll<br>
swallowed whole in darkness<br>
black as buried coal<br>
vestry candles sanctify<br>
unrequited prayers<br>
Reverend Drake stands trembling<br>
gazing down the chancel stairs<br>
<br>
Who comes calling tonight?<br>
