![thumb](assets/images/season0_thumb.jpg)This was the very first session of what was _supposed to be_ just a oneshot... but would become a full campaign. [Tower of the Time Wizard](assets/images/tower_of_the_time_wizard.pdf) is a fun, one-page, dungeon, written by Andrew Harshman. In this 3 part podcast, we run Andrew's one-pager using the [World of Dungeons](http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf) ruleset.

This was my first time running _WoDu_, and so we take a good amount of time talking about characters and rules.

Also, apologies for the excessive echo in this session... we fixed this in subsequent sessions. WOOPS!


### Cast
