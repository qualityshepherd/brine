### WHO IN THE WORLD ARE YOU?

Your character is a product of the world; they start with three `Names` that describe their place in it. `Names` are epithets that might be a role they fill, an identity or something whispered about them. They are actionable, will be used in play and may change, and/or be awarded through play (up to six).

1. Create three `Names` that define your character; here are some prompts to help:

- What role does your character have in the world? Eg. Reluctant Captain, Aging Herbalist, Corrupt Spy
- Anything from their past? Eg. Orphaned Princess, Butcher's Boy, Bee Queen
- What trait describes them? eg. Arrogant, Devoted, Flamboyant
- Do they have a strong relationship? Eg. Husband, Mother, Lover
- Are they known for something? Eg. Scholar, Duelist, Fighter, From Planet Xerf
- Do they own something of note? Eg. The Good Ship Revenge, A Xerfian Protoblaster, Pet Falcon
- Do they have a strong belief? Eg. For Queen and Country, Anarchy!, The Way of the Snail

2. Write down 3 words that describe your character's look, features or vibe.
3. Name your character

Your character has typical gear based on their `Names`. Consider making any extravagant gear a `Name`.


#### Legendary Names

Legendary Names are earned by legendary actions in play and awarded by the table during a `Retrospective`. This can be both good and bad. Legends may not need to roll in certain circumstances and their fame might bring help from admirers. But they may also attract wannabes looking to become a legend by defeating one. WATCH YER FUCKIN BACK!


### DICE

When a character does something _risky_, roll `1d6`; add an additional `d6` if they have a relevant `Name`. Another for a `Legendary Name` (or don't roll at all).

Highest die is:
- 5-6 SUCCESS! Circumstance might differentiate between levels of success.
- 4 devil's bargain: players describe a reasonable success or failure; the GM describes the other; the two negotiate and balance between the two.
- 1-3 nuanced failure.

Help: after a roll, if the fiction dictates, a character may ask another character for help. The helping player rolls (including any applicable skills) and both characters share in the result.


#### Die of Fate
> The die of fate might be rolled to establish the weather, indicate an NPC’s attitude, determine moral or any number of other things. You will roll this often!

Roll 1D6:
- 5-6 something good!
- 3-4 something revealing
- 1-2 something bad


#### Injuries

- Bruised: punch, winded, fall, kicked in the tender bits. You might feel this in the morning but rub some dirt on it and you'll shake it off in a few minutes.
- Bloodied: stab, cut, internal bleeding. A nights rest should heal these but take too many and you might bleed out.
- Broken: rib, limb, concussed, you're done for the day and maybe the week.
- Buried: you're dead but maybe you can bargain with Death? You'll add a new `Name` (eg. _Marked by Death`)... I'm sure it'll be fine :thinking:


### MAGIC

Magic is an innate gift that connects a mage to the world. Casting magic requires a token --a physical object of the world--, speech and the mage's touch. The use of magic can unbalance the mage's connection with the world until it is repaired.

To Cast, roll 2d6:
- The higher die determines success (see `DICE`)
- The lower determines impact or damage
- A mage can take on a `Burden` and automatically succeed. Burdens are an imbalance in the world and represented by a random Tarot card. Until balance is restored, casting rolls are inverted: success is now the lower die.
- Magi who take on 3 burdens become lost in the world.
- `Enhancement Spells` are woven in tandem with a primary spell, and can amplify potency, duration, or scope. While they enhance the spell's efficacy, they take time and compound the risks of casting.
- Rituals offer the most powerful magic but take time and resources
- Fae may be summoned and bargained with. GOOD LUCK!

#### Burden Resolution

- **Symbolic Resolution**: The Tarot card's meaning suggests the path to balance; use both upright and reversed meanings as guides.
- **Balance Through Opposition**: Counter the magic used with its opposite force (fire/water, creation/destruction, etc).
- **Physical Quest**: Complete a journey or task that mirrors the burden; gather components, perform rituals, or make amends.
- **Personal Cost**: Accept a permanent scar, sacrifice a Name, or gain a Name that acknowledges the burden.


#### Books of Magic

Tomes of magic are rare indeed. It is a fool who would possess one without the means of protective wards. It is popular to hide magic within more common tomes. For example, a mage reading carefully, may find spells within _"Soil and Splendor: A Gardener's Guide to Flourishing Greenery"_ or _"Linguistic Lore: Unraveling the Tapestry of Tongues"_.


#### Rituals
- take time
- first you must x
- expensive/rare components
- might only achieve a partial effect
- you might need help (another mage with an appropriate alliance)
- it's dangerous
- requires a location or day of the month/year


### ENCUMBRANCE

Characters can carry what makes sense. Unless they have a Name that could be argued otherwise, characters can carry one or _maybe_ two bulky items. Bulky is defined as something that might require two hands to wield, affect balance or speed, or make tight space difficult to navigate.


### REFLECTIONS

At the end of each session, go around the table and reflect on each of the characters, one by one. Did the character earn a new Name (up to six)? Has one of their Names changed? Comments on the state of the game may also be discussed.


### GM MUSINGS

By the powers vested in me (which are none), I give you permission to do anything, change anything or ignore anything that results in a better game for you and your players. Forever.

That said, here is some rather _opinionated_ advice for GMing **OYAB**. As always, YMMV.

- **Alignment:** Don't _tell_ me your alignment... _show_ me your alignment through play.
- **Initiative:** The coolest part of `Initiative`... is saying **roll initiative!** Given a group of reasonable size (2-5 PCs), _cinematic jump cuts_ (camera-like jumps between players/situations; that follow the narrative) are a great alternative. It also works well with a split party.
- **Splitting the Party:** ALWAYS split the party. It's a hoot.
- **Balance:** TL;DR: don't worry about it! PCs should be smart enough to know when they're outmatched. If not, there's always `Last Breath`. Outside of that, rolling new characters is a snap in WoB :)
- **Magic Items:** avoid +1 items; always. Rather devise items that are more _situational_.


### ADVENTURES

- what's the _problem(s)_?
- who does it involve (NPCs/Factions)
- where does it happen (locations)
- how might it affect characters (stakes)
- when will it be beyond help?

### EXAMPLE PLAY


#### Combat

GM: "The Bone Knight advances, his armor clicking like old teeth. What do you do?"

Alice (playing Serra, Names: "Former Royal Guard," "Bearer of Ancient Blade"): "I want to engage him directly – blade to blade. As a Former Royal Guard, I recognize his stance and know these types of warriors."

GM: "Roll with two dice since your Royal Guard training applies here."

*Alice rolls 2d6: 5, 3*

GM: "With a 5, you succeed! Your training serves you well. How do you want to handle this?"

Alice: "I feint low but strike high, using a technique I learned in the palace guard."

GM: "The Bone Knight's armor cracks where your blade strikes. He's Bruised, but he counters with a sweeping blow toward your legs."

Bob (playing Corvus, Names: "Shadow Walker," "Brother's Keeper"): "Can I help Serra? I want to distract him from the shadows."

GM: "Yes, roll with your Shadow Walker Name."

*Bob rolls 2d6: 2, 4*

GM: "With a 4, it's a devil's bargain. What do you think happens?"

Bob: "I successfully distract him, making him miss Serra

GM: "But perhaps the noise draws the attention of his skeletal attendants in the next room?"

Bob: "Yup... that sounds right."

GM: "Perfect. Serra, you see the Bone Knight's blow go wide as Corvus creates a distraction, but you hear the rattling of bones from behind the chapel door..."


#### Magic

GM: "The plague spirits swarm through the village. What do you do?"

Mari (playing Thistle, Names: "Hedge Witch of the Vale," "Grandmother's Student"): "I need to create a barrier. I pull out my bundle of dried thornberry branches – my token – and begin to whisper the old words my grandmother taught me about boundaries and protection."

GM: "Roll your casting."

*Mari rolls 2d6: 2, 1*

GM: "Ooh, both low. The magic resists..."

Mari: "No, I can't let the village down. I'll take on a Burden to force the success."

GM: *Draws a Tarot card* "You pull The Tower. As your spell manifests, a shimmering thorny barrier rises around the village... but something's wrong. Your connection to the world feels upside down, inverted. The thorns in your hand have drawn blood."

Mari: "Worth it to save them. But now my next casting will use the lower die for success..."

Later...

Mari: "I need to heal the mayor's son. Even with my Burden, I have to try."

*Mari rolls 2d6: 5, 3*

GM: "Remember, with your Burden, you use the lower die – that's a 3. The magic slips away, and you feel the thorns in your blood grow sharper..."


#### Burden Resolution:

GM: "The Tower. Destruction of the established. Your protective barrier spell needs balance."

Mari: "The herb wall. My grandmother and I built it, tended it for years..."

GM: "You'd tear it down?"

Mari: "These thorns in my blood... yes. One barrier for another. The scattered herbs might even protect others."

GM: "A fitting price. Show me how you do it."
