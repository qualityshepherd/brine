I like _one page dungeons_. My current campaign started with [Andrew Harshman's](https://dndeed.tumblr.com/post/145693588517/tower-of-the-time-wizard-my-penultimate-winning) one pager... and it sparked almost a year of play so far. One page dungeons are great for one-shots, drop in locations or even just a source to steal from.

So when the 2020 contest came up, I decided to write my own. I _thoroughly_ play tested it... _once_... but it ended up being really fun (isn't it always fun to kill your players' characters?) and it now too, plays a large part in my current campaign.

Anyway, here 'tis... let me know if you end up running it!
