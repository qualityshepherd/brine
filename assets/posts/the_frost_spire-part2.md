description: Oh no! He's hot! A frozen sea is no place for a himbo... I mean, if there is nobody around to gaze lovingly into the eyes; strong jawline and moonstruck mustache of a handsome man... is he really handsome? Oh, and there's some wolves or something... whatever. Now MOVE! You're blocking his moonlight.

A frozen sea is no place for a himbo... I mean, if there is nobody around to gaze lovingly into the eyes; strong jawline and moonstruck mustache of a handsome man... is he really handsome? Oh, and there's some wolves or something... whatever. Now MOVE! You're blocking his moonlight.

**The Frost Spire**

Long ago, when the world was new an elf king was banished and tossed into the sea. His hatred was so great, and so cold, that it froze the water into a spire of ice and he was cursed to drift forever, bringing winter to the world.

_But sometimes, he hungers for the blood of bad children..._
