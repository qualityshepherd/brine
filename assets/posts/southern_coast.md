**The Southern Coast**, in contrast to its harsh landscape, boasts a temperate climate accentuated by gentle sea breezes and occasional coastal fog. Passage to the northern kingdoms is best by sea; avoiding the formidable barriers of the Sorrow Mountains and West Marshes. The region was originally a druidic sanctuary, until the Northern Kings, seeking a remote location for their most dangerous criminals, commissioned the construction of a prison; or as they put it, _"a place to throw our trash"_. Recognizing the need for magical restraints, they enlisted the expertise of renowned magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane. Additionally, missionaries were funded to provide support for the prison's operation and potentially convert the remaining druids.

With these pillars of civilization established, the Southern Coast has begun to attract adventurous individuals seeking to make it their home.


### WHAT IS THIS?

The Southern Coast is a system neutral, regional setting designed for sandbox exploration and adventure. Details are intentionally vague in order to accommodate YOUR campaign. It is intended to be serviceable as-is while providing just enough flavor to spark imagination. GMs are encouraged to add or ignore content to suit their table.


### SITUATIONS

2. Loggers in the Starwoods have been attacked by a creature they claim is a wendigo. They've sent a desperate plea to the Monastery for aid.
1. The Crown's Fury, a ship lost in the Battle of Mistwood, was _busting_ with treasure when it sank. The rumors of a "ghost ship" seen off the coast are well established but an eye witness swears that it's The Crown's Fury.
1. A local herbalist seeks brave adventurers to retrieve herbs that grow deep within the West Marshes, promising silver and potent potions as reward. He discretely supplies the followers of both "The River" _and_ the Lost Druid. Neither party would be pleased if they knew about the other.
1. An infamous game hunter, and friend to the Northern Kings, will pay handsomely for help finding/tracking/killing a wendigo.
1. A Duke's son found a treasure map leading to the Isle of Wights and has not been heard from for a week. His last letter mentioned white berries that heal any wound.
1. A messenger from the Northern Kings needs safe passage to Yagul Fane. They're carrying sensitive documents about the royal funding of both institutions.
1. Lady Goodknight of the Fae Court demands the return of magical items stolen by "The River" and his cult (and others).
1. The Prison of Mon is _quietly_ investigating why their binding runes are weakening. They suspect the Hag Kalg but it's actually the Lost Druid syphoning their power.
1. A Northern King's bastard is hiding among the Prophet's followers. Both assassins and royal agents are searching the mountains.
1. Maude's bees are dying and Harlan's famous hops are the likely cause. Both businesses are crucial to the Monastery's beer production.
1. Jailers report Hag Kalg whispering in an unknown language; prisoners in adjacent cells complain about dreams of a dark dragon.


### RUMORS

2. The Isle of Wights is aptly named. It's overrun with wights looking to add to their number. Nobody comes back from that retched place.
1. Some crazy druid up in the mountains has got himself a harem and is performing miracles!
1. Yagul Fane is built atop an ancient city with unimaginable magical treasures (BYOD: _Bring Your Own Dungeon_).
1. Have you ever known purveyors of magic and religion to get along? There's tension between Yagul Fane and the monastery... count on it.
1. Greever's Lighthouse is full of ghosts. They sometimes activate the old light to summon a spectral ship from the depths.
1. The mountain mists are the breath of ancient dragons. Dragons ruled this place. The Lost Druid says they'll return once their food source is replenished.
1. Word is the Council of Six in Yagul Fane are trying to unseat the Fae Court; appointing "more cooperative" officials.
1. Maude's bees make special honey from Moonlight Mushrooms. Monastery pays triple for those jars - says it helps them 'see clearly'.
1. Fellstead's abbess and Mon's warden are friendly. VERY friendly if you know what I mean...
1. Watch for Rune Stones in the dunes. Nomads say they're portals at twilight. But careful! You might end up leagues away... or worse.
1. Some of those 'stones' in the Bone Cairn? Them's dragon eggs! That's why they move at night; they're getting ready to hatch.


### LOCATIONS

**Freemoon Forest** stretches westward along the South Sea and is home of many rare botanicals. Wildflowers scent the air and the wind resonates like a familiar melody. Mortals avoid this "Fae Land" whenever possible; those who cannot are wise to hire a guide to help with any Fae "curiosities". This is especially good advice should you find yourself a defendant in the Fae Court. The court's queen, **Lady Goodknight** (`Queen, Grandparent, Peevish`), has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to protecting the forest and the secrets of Fae magic.

Swaths of forest are being ravaged by fire, leaving the haunting beauty of a charred landscape. A dragon? But no confirmed sightings... yet.

 2d6 | Freemoon Forest Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Shadow Dragon** An ancient dragon that's nearly indistinguishable from natural shadows. Only solid when breathing fire, during twilight, or when it wishes to be. It communes with the imprisoned Hag Kalg through shadow-speech.
 3   | 2d6 **Druid Followers** demand an offering.
 4   | d6+1 **Redcaps** If you see one, it's because they want you to or you're marked. Once they outnumber you, out come the razors. Fresh blood for their caps! These are getting drunk and throwing an axe at a mortal tied to a rotting stump. First one to "hit" loses. The more they drink the closer they get.
 5   | **Lamp Boy** A small figure with silver coins for eyes and a darkened brass lamp beckons silently for the party to follow. It has been commissioned by Lady Goodknight, to lead them to the Fae Court for judgment.
 6   | **Fae Court** The air shimmers and a court materializes around the party. They are immediately found guilty of stealing a fae trinket and banished from Freemoon Forest. Roll d6 for their task: <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><li>1-2: Return the Nymph's Tear from The River </li><li>3-4: Retrieve the Sylph Ring from the shipwreck </li><li>5-6: Recover the Dryad's Branch from the Boat Hag</li></ul>
 7   | **Sculpture Garden** with dozens of lifelike stone statues, including a mesmerizing medusa sculpture... reflected in a full length mirror just beside her.
 8   | **Wailing Trees** mournful cries echo through the ancient woods. Those who hear become despondent and have a 2 in 6 chance of sleeplessness from haunting nightmares that last d6 nights.
 9   | 3d6 **Moonlight Mushrooms**, a very rare and valuable fungi. If consumed, they offer visions of near future events, at the cost of a single sleepless night and pains from deep laughter.
 10  | **Enchanted Clearing** A perfect circle of glowing fae flowers. Their nectar grants visions but picking them risks the wrath of their caretaker: a dryad who trades fairly but punishes theft with eternal servitude.

**Twilight Sands** As day transitions into night, shifting dunes and pristine white grains shimmer with an incorporeal glow. This landscape presents a mystical spectacle where reality blurs and secrets are laid bare. Despite its brilliancy, the sand is surprisingly cold to the touch. But it reflects and amplifies the sun's rays with mesmerizing and blinding affect... sometimes literally.

Nomadic tribes may lay claim to certain areas, and conflicts over resources are not uncommon among them. They are quick to dismiss any hint of authority from Yagul Fane and their "wizzards".

 2d6 | Twilight Sands Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Sandits** submerge a triangular stone in water, unleashing a localized sandstorm. They attack in the blinding chaos; appearing from seemingly nowhere (using Rune Stones). More water creates larger storms, from "stinging eyes" to "buried alive".
 3   | 2d6 **Dune Crawlers** Large, insect-like creatures that scuttle effortlessly over sands. They burrow just under the sand wait to strike...
 4   | d6 **Dust Devils** Your weapons are useless against these whirling tornadoes of sand. They drain moisture from living things, leaving victims parched and weakened. The only defense is to lie flat or find solid cover - fighting just feeds their winds.
 5   | **Ghost Caravan**, half-buried remnants of a merchant caravan. Among the weathered wagons: spice barrels (still fragrant), bolts of silk (perfectly preserved), and brass-bound chests. The ghostly merchants defend their cargo; still hoping to complete their delivery to Yagul Fane.
 6 | **Trapped Dybbuk** A spirit trapped in an ornate silver cage, unable to possess the living. She has a letter containing an ancient possession ritual. If the party delivers this letter to someone of their choosing, she will share the victim's wealth once possessed.
 7   | **Rune Stone** a weathered stone that transports anyone touching it to its twin in an adjacent hex (d6: 6=North, continuing clockwise) during twilight (1 hour at dusk/dawn). This is the secret to the Sandits appearing from nowhere and they will kill to protect it. The stones are typically half-buried in sand and easily overlooked.
 8   | **Lost Mage** asks the party how to get back to Yagul Fane without admitting the he is lost.
 9   | **Nomadic Tribe** Know the sands better than you know your home. Their hospitality is legendary, their vengeance more so. They may trade information in exchange for assistance in fending off Sandits.
 10  | **Oasis Mirage**, a cache of valuable relics hidden beneath the shimmering surface of water. Grasping at them yields only sand. Twilight reveals the truth: they are just a reflection; the real pool floats inverted twenty feet above.

**The Sorrow Mountains** divide the eastern Starwoods from the Freemoon Forest to the west. The moniker derives from the perpetual mist that shrouds their rugged peaks. Within their depths lies the Prison of Mon. Visitors speak of a palpable sense of foreboding and the feeling of unseen eyes peering into their very soul.

 2d6 | Sorrow Mountains Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | d6 **Bears** deceptively quick for their size. Their burst speed and reach catch most prey off guard. You'll only underestimate them once.
 3   | 2d6 **Wolves** hunt with cunning and keen senses. Their pack mentality means you're likely surrounded before you know it. You might want to stay close to a fire... or a spear.
 4   | A recent **Landslide** blocks the way ahead, requiring detour or clearing
 5   | **Lamp Boy** A small figure with silver coins for eyes and a darkened brass lamp beckons silently for the party to follow. It has been commissioned by prison officials. Those bearing proper prison documents or official business are led safely to Mon's gates. Others... directly to the Jailers.
 6   | **Abandoned Campsite** with scattered belongings, bloodstains, and tracks leading into a copse of trees
 7   | **Fighting Giants** duel with boulder, echoing like thunder through the mountains. One takes a devastating hit to the knee; his roar of pain shaking the valley. The winner's prize remains to be seen.
 8   | **A Flock of Goats** bleat and traverse the steep cliffs with amazing ease
 9   | **A Distressed Griffon** caught in a bear trap, its proud head thrashing in pain. Voices approach from the distance - likely the poachers who set the trap. Time for a choice.
 10  | **Waterfall Pool** reveals scattered silver coins shimmering from beneath 20' of freezing water
 11+ | No encounter

**Starwoods** is an ancient forest nestled along the coast. Tangled briars and gnarled roots clutch the dirt like fingers. A dense canopy diffuses sunlight, casting a mesmerizing play of light and shadow upon the forest floor. Towering behemoths, prized for their unmatched durability, dominate the landscape and fetch a handsome price.

Legend speaks of a guardian of the woods—-a creature part beast and part spirit—-rumored to possess an insatiable hunger for human flesh.

 2d6 | Starwoods Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Wendigo** Air turns bitter cold as it wind-walks between visible locations. Bites that draw blood infect the victim with insatiable hunger. They will devour all the food on their person... then they will attempt to eat a person and eventually become a Wendigo themselves.
 3   | **Bristled Boars** Seething with inexplicable rage, these shaggy beasts charge without provocation. Their razor tusks and surprising speed make them far more dangerous than common swine.
 4   | **Succubi** with their alluring features framed by cascading locks of midnight hair, weave a hypnotic song laced with secrets of the forest. Those willing to bargain trade in years of their future. Those who don't might still lose a few weeks to a _stolen kiss_.
 5 | **Giant Copper Scale** A massive copper balance bears fae markings. A star stone (fae currency) perfectly counterweights an iron ring - an uneasy truce between realms. Disturbing this balance transforms the surrounding forest, favoring either fae glamour or mortal steel.
 6 | **Treant** Bark bearing the scars of countless axes, this ancient guardian blocks the way. Those carrying axes or open flame face immediate hostility. Otherwise, it presents three acorns: to plant, to eat, to crush. The choices reveal the party's heart to the watching woods.
 7 | **Lost Path** The path ahead literally shifts; trees and undergrowth rearrange themselves before your eyes. The forest's message is clear: you are not welcome this way.
 8   | **Voodoo Dolls** one for each party member, carefully posed upon the forest floor. They're crude but the resemblance is unsettling. Someone has been watching the party long enough to capture their likenesses.
 9   | **Mad Monk** (see Hextras)
 10  | **Ancient Shrine** Carved into an ancient white oak, the shrine holds silver rings; one for each party member, etched with their name. Taking them feels both invited and ominous.
 11+ | No encounter

**West Marshes** sprawl endlessly; a labyrinth of murky waters and treacherous bogs. Quicksand pits lie in wait to ensnare the unwary, while giant leeches slither through the muck. The scent of damp earth and rotting vegetation choke the air. Rare herbs and exotic flora thrive in the damp, fertile soil; coveted by herbalists and alchemists alike.

 2d6 | West Marshes
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | d6 **Bog Trolls** Mossy brutes rise from the muck to ambush prey. Their putrid breath is so foul it requires a save to avoid retching. They hate Marsh Tea's scent and actively seek to destroy it.
 3   | d6 **Swamp Drakes** Flying crocodilian wyrms that snatch prey from above and drag them to underwater lairs. Their wingbeats temporarily part the marsh waters, revealing sunken treasures... and dangers.
 4 | **Mistwood Fallen** 3d6 zombies in rotting military garb, still fighting the Battle of Mistwood. They mistake any armed group for the enemy, but ignore those carrying King Theric's silver stag banner.
 5   | **Quicksand** What is it that's not exactly water and it ain't exactly earth?
 6   | **Bog Myrtle** small shrubs with berries prized for flavoring alcoholic beverages and as an essential oil. Bog Trolls often lurk near productive patches.
 7   | **Marsh Tea** a flowering plant used to treat various ailments, valuable to apothecaries. Collecting it requires wading into deep water where Swamp Drakes hunt.
 8   | **Bog Rosemary** an extremely rare evergreen producing pink flowers essential for healing potions. It only blooms at night and its glow attracts attention.
 9   | **Bog Amber** fossilized tree resin, prized for its beauty and rarity. Some may contain preserved fairy lights, worth much more to Yagul Fane than regular amber. Usually found in Quicksand.
 10 | **Battle Bounty** A heavy chest (2000s, 125lbs) marked with King Theric II's silver stag. The zombies nearby seem to be guarding it rather than attacking.
 11+ | No encounter


### HEXES

**0104 Shadow Dragon Lair** entrance is obscured by shifting shadows created by bioluminescent fungi, which also provide dim illumination throughout the cave. The shadows are nearly indistinguishable from the dragon itself.

Before her incarceration in the Prison of Mon, the Hag Kalg had found the dragon, injured and dying. Her nursing it back to health, created an everlasting bond. The two communicate via shadows, plotting her freedom.

**0209 Greever's Lighthouse** stands weather-beaten, like a skeletal finger pointing to the heavens. Constructed by Ned Greever, whose wife, Ida, met her end by jumping to the cliffs below. Since then, the abandoned lighthouse draws "grievers" who choose a similar fate. All who enter feel a heavy, chilling presence and a lingering sorrow.

Ida's diary lies under her old bed on fourth floor. In it, she reveals that her one true love was the captain of The Crown's Fury. News that his ship was lost in the Battle Mistwood came the same day she lept from the tower. She and the other ghosts activate the old light to summon the ghost ship from the depths.

At the edge of the cliffs is an aged bouquet of purple bog orchids, with a card that reads "My dearest Ida, Your favorite color. Love, Peter".

**Ghost** `Incorporeal, Obsessed, Tragic` - Each bound to this world by unfinished business. Some don't know they're dead. Some do and are very angry about it.

**0302 Lost Druid's Grove** lies nestled amidst the craggy embrace of the Sorrow Mountains. Weathered stone circles show signs of countless ceremonies. The Lost Druid is currently imprisoned in the Prison of Mon. Her remaining 13 followers perform their sacred daily ceremonies but are also nearly finished with a complex ritual tied to her imprisonment. Strangers are tolerated in the grove but NOT at ceremonies.

**0305 Prison of Mon** is carved into rock face of the Sorrow Mountains. Its architecture was designed to blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings, giving it an almost fortress-like appearance. Within its walls, a series of dark, damp, and windowless cells; each lit by a single torch. Prisoners wear a stone rune from a chain that binds them for the length of their sentence. Death is no release. Prisoners that die during their incarceration serve the remainder of their sentence as a Jailer.

The Jailers stand at attention in the prisons long entrance. Their runes' flickering amber glow the only light. Jailers are attuned to truth; any attempt to hide one's true nature, intentions, or possessions triggers a harsh reaction.

Fellstead Monastery provides a monk (on rotation), food, beer and healthcare for the prisoners. Yagul Fane provides magical protections and the runes that bind prisoners to their sentences. Both of these institutions receive _royal endowments_ from the northern kings. There is a 1 in 6 chance that representatives from either or both are currently.

- **Warden Cloudcroft** `Stern, Respected` - Abbes Salvora visits often and a select few know they are "friendly"
- **Captain Kell** `Veteran, Strict,Proud`
- **Jailers** ethereal guards that wear a stone rune; can form a painful astral prison with their touch
- **Gavric the Silent** `Inmate, Assassin`
- **The Hag Kalg** `Inmate` - rumors of her whispering to a dragon-shaped shadow
- **The Lost Druid** `Inmate` - her incarceration was a necessary sacrifice to complete a complex ritual
- 4 workers; 6 human guards; 6 Jailers

**0310 The Bone Cairn** is a puzzling landmark. A massive pile of bones arranged in the form of a cairn. If the bones are toppled, they inexplicably restack themselves at twilight, defying explanation.

**0408.1 The Mirage Merchant** A caravan camped near the Twilight Sands; A merchant sells trinkets that have magical effects at twilight. 1 in 6 is _actually_ magical.

**0412 Isle of Wights** is overrun by bushes bearing a milky white berries. Eating these berries within an hour of picking grants full health. After that hour, they are poisonous. The ground is littered with dead chalky-white birds, each with a berry in their mouth. Victims turn a stark white color adding to the common misunderstanding of the isle. There are no _wights_ on the island. This was a rumor perpetrated by pirates to scare off visitors and protect their buried treasures.

**0502 Prophet for Profit** Tulver Witherspoon was a young navigator on a ship wrecked off the coast [#1508]. As he washed ashore, he was technically dead for 9 minutes. He awoke a changed man and now refers to himself as "The River". He sought out the druids but broke from them to start his own flock... a _new_ sort of navigator. He's a bit of a sensation and has 42 followers; 17 are true believers that will fight to the death for him. He stole a number of trinkets from the fae (old habits) including a **Nymph's Tear**, a tear shaped gemstone.

  d6 | He says shit like
:---:|:--------------------
 1   | "I've navigated the treacherous currents of fate. Call me 'The River' I flow with the wisdom of the ages."
 2   | "Feel my current, my power, swirling like the mighty river. I will chart your course."
 3   | "I'm the compass, guiding you through life's stormy waters."
 4   | "Aye, I once sailed the seas, but now I navigate the waters of the unknown."
 5   | "You don't want to know what lurks in those murky depths."
 6   | "As ebb and flow commands."

**0607 Runes in the Dunes** is a phenomenon that occurs at twilight. As the first light breaks over the horizon, intricate patterns like ancient runes emerge in the shifting sands. These patterns vary in complexity and design, appearing and disappearing with the rhythm of the sunrise. Locals believe these runes hold secrets or messages from the spirits of the desert. Others see them as a natural wonder, a testament to the enigma of the dunes. Regardless, witnessing the Runes in the Dunes is a captivating experience, drawing travelers and curious onlookers alike to behold the artistry of the desert dawn.

**0608 Yagul Fane** is marked by two imposing stone towers, erected by the legendary magi, Naz Yagul and Uma Fane. The Council of Six governs the site, with the head of Fellstead Monastery playing tie-breaker. Access beyond the ground floors is limited to magi and staff, and protected by formidable wards and spells. Residents are esteemed for their mastery of magical disciplines, drawing scholars and adventurers from distant lands.

Surrounding the towers is a desert village housing approximately 300 inhabitants. These resilient individuals thrive in the harsh environment, relying on traditional values, adaptability, and self-reliance. Most live in tents; some in permanent stone structures, showcasing their connection to the land.

In the center of the village sits a magical cistern, created by the magi of Yagul Fane, ensuring water for all. This enchanted well symbolizes the community's unity and strength. The villagers engage in herding livestock and participating in trade as part of their daily activities.

- **Gareth** `Next in line for Council of 6, Necromancer, Sweet tooth`
- **Captain Yorik** `Guard, Hunter, Daring`
- **The Broker** `Fence, Embroiderer, Methodical`
- **Narla** `Alchemist, Pretty, 3 Husbands`
- **Sorrel** `Priest, Trailblazer, Passionate`
- **Cirian** `Sage, Cartwright, Creative`
- **Flax** `Barkeep, Assassin, Funny`
- **Liren** `Armorer, Wench, Determined`
- **Ursula** `Spy, Cheeky, Displaced, Ward`
- **Mrs Redraven** `Lady-of-the-house, Loyal, Prude`

**0807.6 Barrow of the Cane**
A 12' rune stone carved into a silver speckled, rust-colored stone. It sets upon a small hill marked with rusty grass. The rune tells an elaborate history of **The Cane**, an ancient tribe of warriors. The barrow has an entrance at its base, framed by three monolith stones. The walls within are covered in chalky paintings of men with long spears fighting various monsters; hand prints of men, women and children; and giants in the mountains. The paintings depict families with heads in the shape of various animal spirits. Each cubbyhole is marked with these same animal shapes.

Cubbyholes contain mostly bones but also: obsidian arrowheads, an obsidian axe, a solid silver bear-like idol (400s) and simple silver jewelry (120s). There are a number of extremely high quality spear poles; one still with a razor-sharp obsidian tip. Resting in this sacred space aids healing.

If the bones are disturbed a ghost will appear. **Zamma** was the tribe's last shaman. His bones are buried beneath the monolith, just above the ceiling of the main chamber. He cannot speak but will point at various drawings on the walls. He will disappear if the bones are returned to their resting place. Taking anything but the weapons (weapons are to use; treasure is property of the Cane) from the barrow (without trade or sacrifice) curses the thief: their fingers > hand > arm > etc start turning red. When they are completely red the thief dies.

**0904 Harlan's Grove** is renowned for producing the region's finest hops, coveted by brewers for their unparalleled quality. Francis and Catherine Harlan have become quite famous to those in the trade. However, the true secret behind the exceptional hops lies in the soil's rare mineral deposit, discovered by the Harlans generations ago. This mineral imbues the hops with distinctive flavors and aromas, making them highly sought after. Guarding their knowledge closely, the Harlans perpetuate the myth of their unparalleled skill, ensuring their dominance in the hop market.

**1004 Maude's Meadery** Vibrant wildflowers bordered by a meandering stream. the meadery farm presents a picturesque scene straight out of a pastoral painting. The air is perfumed with the sweet aroma of honey, mingling with the earthy scent of the surrounding fields. Rows upon rows of lush, golden-hued honeycombs glisten under the gentle sunlight, tended to by diligent beekeepers clad in weathered leather aprons. In the heart of the farm, a quaint stone cottage stands as the hub of activity, its chimney billowing fragrant smoke from the hearth where mead is brewed in large copper cauldrons. Bees buzz lazily among the blossoms, their diligent work ensuring a plentiful harvest of honey, while workers scurry about, gathering ingredients and preparing barrels for the fermentation process. Amidst the tranquility of the countryside, the meadery farm hums with the rhythmic pulse of nature and the bustling energy of artisanal craftsmanship.

Maude's southwestern hives are all dying. Weather this season has been dry and the bees have been traveling all the way to Harlan's Grove. Their hops is poisoning the hives and Maude is desperate to find the cause. The two farms have been friends for years so she will be slow to accept the truth.

**1108 Fellstead Monastery** is perched upon the edge of the coast and surrounded by lush, rolling hills. The monastery is constructed from warm, honey-colored stone and Gothic architecture. Its walls are adorned with intricate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of St. Fellstead (patron saint of travelers and seekers of knowledge). It is a place of peace and reflection, where people from all walks of life come to seek answers, find comfort, and renew their spirits.

The Monastery boasts a renowned library, a trip of goats that produces fine milk/cheese and a rather fabulous winery and the best beer in the south--thanks to a annual donation of hops from Harlan's Grove [#0904]

A group of pilgrims has come from the north seeking guidance and sanctuary, placing additional strain on the resources and tranquility of the monks.

- **Abbes Salvora** `Devoted, Wise`
- **Prior Cedric** `Rugged, Diligent`
- **Sister Elara** `Druid, Healer, Formerly Lost Druid`
- **Brother Ulfar** `Vintner, Mean Drunk` - avoided but knows wine
- **Brother Estabar** `Monk, Eager` - master goat herder
- **Sir Ealdred** `Knight, Daring` - seeks spiritual clarity after long and brutal campaigns
- **Lady Isolde** `Noble, Selfless` - sought sanctuary from the pressures of court life`
- 28 Monks, 6 pilgrims

**1405 Loggers Camp** in the heart of Starwood Forest; a stark contrast to the natural beauty that surrounds it. The camp is a rough collection of tents and wooden structures. The sounds of axes and saws echo through the trees. The loggers harvest the valuable timber while grappling with their impact on the ancient woodland. To say the druids despise their profession is an understatement. Boss hired a former Druid to help navigate tensions with the druids but he's not sure she's not a spy.

- **Foreman "Boss" Bartok** `Burly, Caring (crew and sustainability of logging)`
- **Lena "Sawbones" Thorne** `Medic, Herbalist, Gentle`
- **Lucia "Twig" Thorne** `Camp Mom, Agile, Cheerful`
- **"Cookie"** `One-armed Logger, Terrible cook`
- **Nyssa "Thumbs" Dunsfold"** `Fallen Druid, Witty, Wholesome`
- 18 loggers

**1408 Fishing Hamlet** with handful of huts. The one closest to the sea belongs to **Pesh**, a fourth-generation fisherman. Buried beneath his hut lies a chest containing 10,000 silver coins salvaged from the shipwreck a mile off the coast. It took him seven trips under the cover of night to retrieve the treasure. Burdened with the fear of attracting bandits, Pesh refuses to spend the treasure. Instead, he makes generous, anonymous donations to the monastery.

The hamlet fears and avoids the Boat Hag [#1506]. They refuse to trade with her and "allegedly" leave rotten fish guts on her doorstep.

**1506 The Boat Hag** A large overturned boat repurposed into a makeshift dwelling. The hull's curvature and the weathered planks remnants of its former life. Within this curious abode resides a reclusive hag. She is sister of Hag Kalg, and known for her extensive knowledge of herbal remedies and potions, which she brews using ingredients gathered from the surrounding marshlands and forests.

Among her possessions is a **Dryad's Whispering Branch**. A slender branch from a dryad's tree. It allows the wielder to communicate with woodland creatures and plants.

**1508 Pirate Shipwreck** lies just off the coast, its remains jutting from the water. Barnacles cling to its splintered boards, broken masts, and rusting cannons. A haunting reminder of the sea's perils. Carved onto a board just above the waterline is "Pesh was here" [#1405]. 2d6 **venomous reef snakes**, camouflaged among the coral, hunt in the wreckage.

Among the treasure was also a **Sylph Ring**. A pewter ring marked with the fae rune for air, that summons gentle, calming winds.

**1603 Old Pete's Boggery** stands as a testament to human resilience. With his daughter Ida and a dedicated team of 12 hands, Pete toils tirelessly to extract valuable peat from the marshes. Despite the challenges posed by the terrain, the farm not only sustains itself but also provides a crucial resource for the surrounding communities. Nobody knows the marshes better than Pete and his daughter.


### HEXTRAS

The following hex/encounters can be used as random situations throughout the Southern Coast as the GM requires.

1. **Shadow Walker** A robed woman sits cross legged in the sand. She's waiting for the sun to either come out or be at the right moment so she can shadowalk to her intended destination. Once the shadows are just right, she will walk into it, through a disorienting maze of darkness and out of another shadow elsewhere. Shadow walking is tricky; the traveler may come out feet or miles off course. The woman might teach PCs how it works... for a price.

2. **Classic Traveler** A rather tall man walks with a limp next to an empty two-cart train pulled by two large oxen. He will introduce himself as **Malfas**. Malfas is an alien in human form and a few hundred years early to play basketball. The oxen are mechanical which only cutting them would reveal. Only their crazy strength would be telling that they are not real oxen. Their names are Jake and Jim. The traveler has 5 marbles that can perform what some would call miracles. He used one to make Jake, Jim and the cart. He needs one to return home. He's looking for work but really wants to study humans.

3. **Mad Monk** is dressed in pink robes of an improbable shade of bright pink. His eyes dart with a manic glint, and he mumbles to himself incoherently. He's out of water and will ask the PCs if they can spare any. He's quite mad... he's looking for a door. He might remember his name is **Jaral**.

4. **Four Leaf Clover Field** A field of ONLY four leaf clovers... finding a THREE leaf clover brings the bearer luck.

5. **Aware Wolf** Buzzards circle overhead 100 yards off. The target is a goat carcass that looks to have been mostly devoured by wolves. A werewolf in human form sleeps soundly in a nearby thicket. Slender with dark curly hair and covered in blood; his name is **Zander**. He will try to avoid notice and pretend to be looking for a lost dog if noticed. Zander and his pack only pose a threat at night. He speaks to a dead friend...

6. **Fare Fight** A copper-skinned warrior named **Lunara** (`Warrior, Proud`) is fighting three armored traders; her broken spear lodged in one trader's shoulder, she now wields daggers.
