**The Southern Coast**, despite its rugged terrain, enjoys a mild climate shaped by soft sea breezes and rolling coastal fog. Passage to the northern kingdoms is best conducted by sea; circumventing the Sorrow Mountains and the West Marshes. This land once served as a sacred druidic sanctuary until the Northern Kings, seeking an isolated location for their most notorious criminals, ordered the construction of a prison—or as they coldly declared, _"a place to throw our trash."_ To contain their prisoners through mystical means, they recruited the celebrated magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane. The crown also funded missionaries, ostensibly to support the prison's operations while attempting to convert the resident druids.

With these foundations of civilization in place, the Southern Coast draws settlers eager to carve out new lives in this frontier.


### WHAT IS THIS?
The Southern Coast is a system-neutral, regional setting designed for sandbox exploration and adventure. Details are intentionally left vague to seamlessly integrate with YOUR campaign. The setting provides enough flavor to spark imagination while remaining flexible enough to use as-is. GMs are encouraged to modify or ignore content to best suit their table.


### SITUATIONS

2. Loggers in the Starwoods have been attacked by a creature they claim is a wendigo. They've sent a desperate plea to the Monastery for aid.
1. The Crown's Fury, a ship lost in the Battle of Mistwood, was _bursting_ with treasure when it sank. Rumors of a "ghost ship" seen off the coast are well established but a witness swears that it's The Crown's Fury.
1. A local herbalist seeks brave adventurers to retrieve herbs that grow deep within the West Marshes, promising silver and potent potions as reward. He discreetly supplies the followers of both "The River" _and_ the Lost Druid; knowledge that would please neither party.
1. An infamous game hunter, and friend to the Northern Kings, will pay handsomely for help finding/tracking/killing a wendigo.
1. A Duke's son found a treasure map leading to the Isle of Wights and has not been heard from for a week. His last letter mentioned white berries that heal any wound.
1. A messenger from the Northern Kings needs safe passage to Yagul Fane. They're carrying sensitive documents about the royal funding of both institutions.
1. Lady Goodknight of the Fae Court demands the return of all fae artifacts; no exceptions. Generous rewards await those who comply.
1. The Prison of Mon is _quietly_ investigating why their binding runes are weakening. They suspect the Hag Kalg but it's actually the Lost Druid syphoning their power.
1. A Northern King's bastard hides among the followers of "The River". Royal agents—aka assassins—seek his "safe return".
1. Maude's bees are dying and Harlan's famous hops are the likely cause. Both businesses are crucial to the Monastery's beer production.
1. Jailers report Hag Kalg whispering in an unknown language; prisoners in adjacent cells complain about dreams of a dark dragon.


### RUMORS

2. The Isle of Wights is aptly named. It's overrun with wights looking to add to their number. Nobody comes back from that wretched place.
1. Some crazy druid up in the mountains has got himself a harem and is performing miracles!
1. Yagul Fane is built atop an ancient city with unimaginable magical treasures.
1. Have you ever known purveyors of magic and religion to get along? There's tension between Yagul Fane and the monastery... count on it.
1. Greever's Lighthouse is full of ghosts. They activate the old light to summon a spectral ship from the depths.
1. The mountain mists are the breath of dragons who once ruled this place. The Lost Druid says they'll return once their food source is replenished.
1. Word is the Council of Six in Yagul Fane are trying to unseat the Fae Court; appointing "more cooperative" officials.
1. Maude's bees make special honey from Moonlight Mushrooms. The Monastery pays triple for those jars; say it helps 'em _see clearly_.
1. Fellstead's abbess and Mon's warden are friendly. VERY friendly if you know what I mean...
1. Watch for runes in the dunes. Nomads call them _twilight portals_. But careful! You might end up leagues away... or worse.
1. Some of those 'stones' in the Bone Cairn? Them's dragon eggs! That's why they fidget at night; they're gonna hatch!


### LOCATIONS

**Freemoon Forest** stretches westward along the South Sea and is home of many rare botanicals. Wildflowers scent the air and the wind resonates like a familiar melody. Mortals avoid this "Fae Land" whenever possible; those who cannot are wise to hire a guide to help with any Fae "curiosities". This is especially good advice should you find yourself a defendant in the Fae Court. The court's queen, **Lady Goodknight** (`Imperial, Prejudiced, Grandparent`), has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to protecting the forest and the secrets of Fae magic.

Stretches of forest lie burned to ash, creating an eerie beauty in the devastation. The pattern of destruction suggests a dragon, though none have been sighted... yet.

 2d6 | Freemoon Forest Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Shadow Dragon** A dragon that is nearly indistinguishable from natural shadows. Only visible when breathing fire, at twilight, or when it wishes to be. It communes with the imprisoned Hag Kalg through shadow-speech.
 3   | **Druid Followers** (2d6) demand an offering.
 4   | **Redcaps** (d6+1) If you see one, it's because they want you to or you're marked. Once they outnumber you, out come the razors. Fresh blood for their caps! These are getting drunk and throwing an axe at a mortal tied to a rotting stump. First one to "hit" loses. The more they drink the closer they get.
 5   | **Lamp Boy** A small figure with silver coins for eyes and a darkened brass lamp beckons silently for the party to follow. It has been commissioned by Lady Goodknight, to lead outsiders to the Fae Court for judgment.
 6   | **Fae Court** The air shimmers and a court materializes around the party. They are immediately found guilty of stealing a fae trinket and banished from Freemoon Forest. Roll d6 for their task: <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><li>1-2: Return the Nymph's Tear from The River [#0502] </li><li>3-4: Retrieve the Sylph Ring from the shipwreck [#1508] </li><li>5-6: Recover the Dryad's Branch from the Boat Hag [#1506]</li></ul>
 7   | **Sculpture Garden** with dozens of lifelike stone statues, including a mesmerizing medusa sculpture... reflected in a full length mirror just beside her.
 8   | **Wailing Trees** mournful cries echo through the ancient woods. Those who hear become despondent and have a 2 in 6 chance of sleeplessness from haunting nightmares that last d6 nights.
 9   | **Moonlight Mushrooms** (3d6), a very rare and valuable fungi. If consumed, they offer visions of near future events, at the cost of a single sleepless night and pains from deep laughter.
 10  | **Enchanted Clearing** A perfect circle of glowing fae flowers. Their nectar grants visions but picking them risks the wrath of their caretaker: **The Hollow Sister** (`Open Arms, Curious, The Heart`), who trades fairly but punishes theft with eternal servitude.

**Twilight Sands** As day transitions into night, shifting dunes and pristine white grains shimmer with an incorporeal glow. This landscape presents a mystical spectacle where reality blurs and secrets are laid bare. Despite its brilliancy, the sand is surprisingly cold to the touch. But it reflects and amplifies the sun's rays with mesmerizing and blinding affect... perhaps _literally_ if gazing too long.

Nomadic tribes lay claim to certain areas, and conflicts over resources are not uncommon among them. They are quick to dismiss any hint of authority from Yagul Fane and their "wizzards".

 2d6 | Twilight Sands Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Sandits** submerge a triangular stone in water, unleashing a localized sandstorm. They attack in the blinding chaos; appearing from seemingly nowhere (using rune stones). More water creates larger storms, from "stinging eyes" to "buried alive".
 3   | **Dune Crawlers** (2d6) Large, insect-like creatures that scuttle effortlessly over sands. They burrow just under the sand wait to strike...
 4   | **Dust Devils** (d6) Your weapons are useless against these whirling tornadoes of sand. They drain moisture from living things, leaving victims parched and weakened. The only defense is to lie flat or find solid cover—fighting just feeds their winds.
 5   | **Ghost Caravan**, half-buried remnants of a merchant caravan. Among the weathered wagons: spice barrels (still fragrant), bolts of silk (perfectly preserved), and brass-bound chests. The ghostly merchants defend their cargo; still hoping to complete their delivery to Yagul Fane.
 6 | **Trapped Dybbuk** A spirit trapped in an ornate silver cage, unable to possess the living. She has a letter containing an ancient possession ritual. If the party delivers this letter to someone of their choosing, she will share the victim's wealth once possessed.
 7   | **Rune Stone** a weathered stone that transports anyone touching it to its twin in an adjacent hex (d6: 6=North, continuing clockwise) during twilight (1 hour at dusk/dawn). This is the secret to the Sandits appearing from nowhere and they will kill to protect it. The stones are typically half-buried in sand and easily overlooked.
 8   | **Lost Mage** asks the party how to get back to Yagul Fane without admitting the he is lost.
 9   | **Nomadic Tribe** Know the sands better than you know your home. Their hospitality is legendary, their vengeance more so. They may trade information in exchange for assistance in fending off Sandits.
 10  | **Oasis Mirage**, a cache of valuable relics hidden beneath the shimmering surface of water. Grasping at them yields only sand. Twilight reveals the truth: they are just a reflection; the real pool floats inverted twenty feet above.

**The Sorrow Mountains** divide the eastern Starwoods from the Freemoon Forest to the west. The moniker derives from the perpetual mist that shrouds their rugged peaks. Within their depths lies the Prison of Mon. Visitors speak of a palpable sense of foreboding and the feeling of unseen eyes peering into their very soul.

 2d6 | Sorrow Mountains Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Bears** (d6)deceptively quick for their size. Their burst speed and reach catch most prey off guard. You'll only underestimate them once.
 3   | **Wolves** (2d6) hunt with cunning and keen senses. Their pack mentality means you're likely surrounded before you know it. You might want to stay close to a fire... or a spear.
 4   | A recent **Landslide** blocks the way ahead, requiring detour or clearing
 5   | **Lamp Boy** A small figure with silver coins for eyes and a darkened brass lamp beckons silently for the party to follow. It has been commissioned by prison officials. Those bearing proper prison documents or official business are led safely to Mon's gates. Others... directly to the Jailers.
 6   | **Abandoned Campsite** with scattered belongings, bloodstains, and tracks leading into a copse of trees. Embers still smoke in the fire pit.
 7   | **Fighting Giants** duel with boulder, echoing like thunder through the mountains. One takes a devastating hit to the knee; his roar of pain shaking the valley. The winner's prize remains to be seen.
 8 | **A Flock of Goats** bleat and traverse the steep cliffs with amazing ease. Their bells are pure silver, and their herder is suspiciously absent.
 9   | **A Distressed Griffon** caught in a bear trap, its proud head thrashing in pain. Voices approach from the distance—likely the poachers who set the trap. Time for a choice.
 10  | **Waterfall Pool** reveals scattered silver coins shimmering from beneath 20' of freezing water
 11+ | No encounter

**Starwoods** An ancient forest nestled along the coast, where tangled briars and gnarled roots clutch the dirt like fingers. A dense canopy diffuses sunlight, casting a mesmerizing play of light and shadow upon the forest floor. Towering behemoths, prized for their unmatched durability, dominate the landscape and fetch a handsome price.

The trees remember the old laws. Axes that strike too deeply turn on their wielders; paths that stray too far vanish without a trace. The forest is ruled by **The Three Sisters** [#1403]: one of ruthless order, one of patient observation, and one lying in wait.

Legend speaks of a guardian of the woods—a creature part beast and part spirit—rumored to possess an insatiable hunger for human flesh.

 2d6 | Starwoods Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Wendigo** Air turns bitter cold as it wind-walks between visible locations. Bites that draw blood infect the victim with insatiable hunger. They will devour all the food on their person... then they will attempt to eat a person and eventually become a Wendigo themselves.
 3   | **Bristled Boars** Seething with inexplicable rage, these shaggy beasts charge without provocation. Their razor tusks and surprising speed make them far more dangerous than common swine.
 4   | **Succubi** with their alluring features framed by cascading locks of midnight hair, weave a hypnotic song laced with secrets of the forest. Those willing to bargain trade in years of their future. Those who don't might still lose a few weeks to a _stolen kiss_.
 5 | **Giant Copper Scale** A massive copper balance bears fae markings. A star stone (fae currency) perfectly counterweights an iron ring—an uneasy truce between realms. Disturbing this balance transforms the surrounding forest, favoring either fae glamour or mortal steel.
 6 | **Treant** Bark bearing the scars of countless axes, this ancient guardian blocks the way. Those carrying axes or open flame face immediate hostility. Otherwise, it presents three acorns: to plant, to eat, to crush. The choices reveal the party's heart to the watching woods.
 7 | **Lost Path** The path ahead literally shifts; trees and undergrowth rearrange themselves before your eyes. The forest's message is clear: you are not welcome this way.
 8   | **Voodoo Dolls** one for each party member, carefully posed upon the forest floor. They're crude but the resemblance is unsettling. Someone has been watching the party long enough to capture their likenesses.
 9   | **Mad Monk** (`Seer, Unending Thirst, Ravings of Truth`) A figure in impossibly pink robes stumbles forward out of nowhere. His eyes dart with a manic glint and he mumbles to himself incoherently. He will ask the PCs if they can spare any water. He's quite mad... and looking for a door—its key hangs from his neck. He might remember his name is **Jaral**.
 10  | **Tree Shrine** Carved into an ancient white oak, the shrine holds silver rings; one for each party member, etched with their name. Taking them feels both invited and ominous.
 11+ | No encounter

**West Marshes** sprawl endlessly along the eastern shore—a labyrinth of murky waters and treacherous bogs. Despite their confusing name, these swamps are home to quicksand pits and giant leeches slithering through the muck. The scent of damp earth and rotting vegetation chokes the air. Rare herbs and exotic flora thrive in these fertile soils, coveted by herbalists and alchemists alike.

 2d6 | West Marshes
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Bog Trolls** (d6) Mossy brutes rise from the muck to ambush prey. Their putrid breath is so foul it requires a save to avoid retching. They hate Marsh Tea's scent and actively seek to destroy it.
 3   | **Swamp Drakes** (d6) Flying crocodilian wyrms that snatch prey from above and drag them to underwater lairs. Their wingbeats temporarily part the marsh waters, revealing sunken treasures... and dangers.
 4 | **Mistwood Fallen** (3d6) zombies in rotting military garb, still fighting the Battle of Mistwood. They mistake any armed group for the enemy, but ignore those carrying King Theric's silver stag banner.
 5   | **Quicksand** What is it that's not exactly water and it ain't exactly earth?
 6   | **Bog Myrtle** small shrubs with berries prized for flavoring alcoholic beverages and as an essential oil. Bog Trolls often lurk near productive patches.
 7   | **Marsh Tea** a flowering plant used to treat various ailments, valuable to apothecaries. Collecting it requires wading into deep water where Swamp Drakes hunt.
 8   | **Bog Rosemary** an extremely rare evergreen producing pink flowers essential for healing potions. It only blooms at night and its glow attracts attention.
 9   | **Bog Amber** fossilized tree resin, prized for its beauty and rarity. Some may contain preserved fairy lights, worth much more to Yagul Fane than regular amber. Usually found in Quicksand.
 10 | **Battle Bounty** A heavy chest (2000s, 125lbs) marked with King Theric II's silver stag. The zombies nearby seem to be guarding it rather than attacking.

### HEXES

**0101 Dark Tower**
A shabby stone tower rises from overgrown grass. Its pale stones etched with fading runes, obscured beneath tangled vines. No path leads to its door; windows dark and silent. Even in bright sun, the tower casts no shadow. **Varjo** (`Shadow Mage, Hermit, Obsessive`), a forgotten mage, now lives within his tower's _shadow_, writing a book he believes will make him immortal. He can't abide trespassers; he calls from his dark tower a warning to any who come too close: _"you there... do fuck off!"_

**0102 Razor's Edge**: A mountain stream violently carves a path, waters churning with deadly fury. A single weathered bridge—more rope and rotting planks than structure—spans the chasm. It looks unlikely to bear anything heavier than a whisper.

**0103 The Alarum Fields** A hidden valley home to rare orange flowers, known as Alarums. When approached, the blossoms emit a soft, high-pitched sound, calling out potential dangers. The flowers are harvested and dried to create natural alarms. They also make a highly sought-after tea, renowned for its ability to strengthen the drinker’s resolve and sharpen their wits.

**0104 Respite Grove** A peaceful grove of tall trees with orange-stained bark. Their leaves drift continuously, carpeting the ground. The air hums with calming energy, urging quiet reflection. Resting here accelerates healing 2x.

**0105 Shadow Dragon Lair** The entrance is obscured by shifting shadows cast by moonlight mushrooms, which dimly illuminate the cave. The shadows are nearly indistinguishable from the dragon itself.

The Hag Kalg found this dragon dying before her imprisonment in Mon. Nursing it back to health forged an everlasting bond. The two now communicate via shadows, plotting her freedom.

**0106 The Scorched Hollow** A barren landscape of blackened trees and ash, where a forest once stood. Charred stumps rise from dead ground, and occasional winds stir ghostly ash patterns. Nothing grows here. Nothing moves. Only silence.

**0107 The Ashen Thicket** A fire-ravaged forest of charred, brittle trees standing over grey ash. Beneath the devastation, faint luminescent shoots struggle through the scorched earth. At night, tiny winged fae move between the burned branches, their soft glows hinting at slow, patient restoration.

**0108 The Smoldering Path** A fire-scarred track winds through the fae forest, air thick with burnt wood. From the devastation, a white tree erupts overnight—bark smooth as bone. Its trunk curves like a dragon's neck, branches spread like wings, adorned with shimmering silver leaves. A wondrous thing of strange beauty.

**0109 Memory Falls** A glittering waterfall spills into a clear pool, its waters tinged with soft, iridescent light. Locals whisper it’s a place where dreams resurface—or memories vanish. Fae keep silent watch from unseen vantages. Those who bathe here emerge changed: some bearing vivid new memories, others vivid new markings and still others, with pieces of themselves gone.

**0110 Bridge to Nowhere** A faintly glowing stream winds through grasslands, its waters shimmering with a peculiar light. A worn rope bridge connects the realm of men to the fae forest. Three brothers (`Grizzled, Stern, Conflicted`) guard the crossing, warning that passage leads to Nowhere—only loss. The youngest, **Tom**, harbors a hidden bond with a forest nymph.

**0111 Key Tree** A tree loams over a  river, its gnarled branches heavy with rusted keys. Some hang by frayed ribbons, others grow straight from the bark like iron thorns.

Turn a key in the air, and somewhere, a distant lock clicks—but what opens remains uncertain. Those who take a key return with unsteady hands and hollow eyes. The keys grow heavier with time... and some doors should remain locked.

**0112 The Wishing Tide** Where a winding river meets the sea, the estuary shifts with each tide—fresh water curling through salt, channels never the same twice. At low tide, pools glisten across the flats, some deep, some vanishing in moments.

In one, a single iridescent shell turns with the current. Speak a wish aloud, and the water ripples, showing a fleeting glimpse of its fulfillment. But nothing changes. The tide will return, and with it, the promise of the wish—only the sea knows when.

**0201 Quiet Holler** A small valley nestled between hills, bisected by a stream flowing south. It is unnaturally quiet here. No birdsong. No wind. Only the feeling of something watching from just beyond sight.

**0202 Keelspire** A hermit astronomer (`Starstruck, Prophetic, Rambling`) has built an observatory from salvaged shipwrecks, improbably perched on a narrow mountain precipice. The upturned keel of a great ship juts skyward, forming the spine of the structure, while rusted hulls and weatherworn timbers cling precariously to the rock. The old iron groans beneath the devastating beauty of the night sky.

**0203 Druid's Aviary** On a mountain plateau, an aviary of stone and weathered wood blends seamlessly into the landscape. Rare birds perch—some shift between forms, others carry voices from afar. Druidic caretakers tend to them, and are unwelcoming to strangers.

**0204 Dead Messenger** A horse pulls a body toward fresh grass, its foot caught in the stirrup. A young messenger—scarlet hat askew—is dead. A letter with an unbroken wax seal peeks from his bag—addressed to **Uwin**. The old paint horse, Buttercup, grazes nervously, ready to bolt.

> The letter reads: "Now that you've gone, it's all rum and sad luck dames. I don't even care if they miss me; I never remember their names. I wonder where you are and find myself whispering your name. They say if you get far enough away, you can always come back home. Meet me at Number 7 and ask for Blind Jane".

**0205 Who Where Those Masked Men** Two masked wrestlers grapple within a perfect circle of salt. Nothing exists beyond their contest. Cross the circle’s edge, and you become part of the match. Break the salt, and **Mërk (Skull Mask) & Bërg (Bear Mask)** will stop immediately, bow to each other, and flee into the wild in separate directions.

**0206 Hanging Tree** A massive tree stands alone, no growth within 20 feet of its base. Hundreds of names etch its trunk—all carved by the same hand, some impossibly ancient. A noose dangles from a stout branch. The tree breathes a somber song, like wind through hollow bones. The names _appear_ after each hanging.

**0207 The Oak** A massive tree with a concealed door that requires a secret knock to enter. Inside, a subterranean pub pulses with music. A fae string band plays enchanted tunes, while dancers move to the mesmerizing rhythms. A silent bartender with eyes like deep wells watches on. Time seems irrelevant here.

**0208 The Ash King** A scorched forest where ash blankets the ground. At its heart, a strange figure known as the **Ash King** (`Self-Appointed Monarch, Alchemist, Irrational Confidence`) has built a brugh of ash. He flavors a potent wine from the burnt landscape—and insists all visitors drink.

**0209 Greever's Lighthouse** stands weather-beaten, like a skeletal finger pointing to the heavens. Constructed by Ned Greever, whose wife, Ida (`Jaded Ghost, Lovelorn, Snippy`), met her end by jumping to the cliffs below. Since then, the abandoned lighthouse draws "grievers" who choose a similar fate. All who enter feel a heavy, chilling presence and a lingering sorrow.

The fourth floor still holds Ida Greever's bed; her diary hidden beneath. In it, she writes of her true love—the captain of The Crown's Fury. The day she learned his ship was lost in the Battle of Mistwood, she leapt from the tower. Now she and other lost souls light the beacon, calling the ghost ship from the depths.

> Ida's diary contains a page ripped from a ships log. It reads: _"Curse those berries—lost two more men this week. But the silver sleeps safe beneath the Bone Tree. Only the tide knows the way."_ see [#0412].

On the cliff's edge, purple bog orchids fade in an ancient bouquet. Its card reads "My dearest Ida, Your favorite color. I will always love you, Peter".

> **Ghost** `Incorporeal, Obsessed, Tragic`—Each bound to this world by unfinished business. Some don't know they're dead. Some do and are very angry about it. _Life is wasted on the living._

**0210 Veil's End** A grim stone manse looms over the cove, more fortress than home. Narrow windows pierce thick, moss-covered walls. Below, a hidden dock shelters a silent pirate ship—colors struck. When **Lyra "Queen" Vex** (`Blades, Queen's Stitch, Generous`) is home, no one asks questions. Her twin daggers strike faster than sight; tap her amulet twice, and time bends—just long enough to kill. Her crew call it _the Queen's Stitch._ All the right people vouch for her... for now.

**0211 Smoked Hamlet**
Charred beams and blackened stones mark where a fishing hamlet once stood. A young noble (`Impulsive, Visionary, Flamboyant`) bought the land for more wealth than the villagers had ever seen. In the fine print: _no sea access_. Now, they watch a new manor house rise from _their_ ashes, trapped between scorched earth and an unreachable tide. Some now beg for work; others _sharpen knives_.

**0301 The Fever Downs** Unnaturally warm hills ripple with heat. Rare herbs grow in perfect concentric circles, their stems trembling without wind. A traveling healer named **Hergest** (`Healer, Old Codger, Opinionated`) harvests plants to brew remedies for body and spirit.

**0302 Lost Druid's Grove** lies nestled amidst the craggy embrace of the Sorrow Mountains. Weathered stone circles show signs of countless ceremonies. Thirteen followers maintain sacred rites despite their leader's imprisonment in Mon. They tolerate respectful visitors to the grove but ceremony days are _strictly_ private.

Ancient runes, similar to those binding Mon's prisoners, are carved into the stones. The circles' placement mirrors the prison's cell layout, though this could be coincidence. Complex chalk markings cover the stones and ground between them, redrawn daily in precise patterns. At night, amber light moves between the marks, though its source remains unclear.

At the grove's heart stands an altar stone—black as pitch and cold to touch. Thirteen hand-prints are burned deep into its surface, each glowing with a faint amber light.

**0303 Nabal's Palisades** Mountains rise like an impenetrable fortress—stone so steep and dense that no living thing could pass. Nothing moves here. Nothing survives. It took its name from the last fool who tried to climb them; his bones a warning to those who would follow.

**0304 Stone Teeth** A vertical wall of mountains blocks passage north. No path exists—just raw stone rising impossibly steep, blocking all approach to the Prison of Mon.

**0305 Prison of Mon** A fortress carved into the Sorrow Mountains, its walls blend seamlessly into the face of the mountain. Dark, damp cells stretch deep within, each lit by a single torch. Prisoners wear runed chains that bind them to their sentences—even death offers no release. Prisoners that die during their incarceration serve the remainder of their sentence as a Jailer.

The ethereal Jailers were once prisoners themselves. They stand eternal watch in the long entrance hall, attuned to truth. Any deception triggers harsh response.

Yagul Fane maintains the binding runes while Fellstead Monastery provides rotating monks, food, and care. Both receive _royal endowments_ from the northern kings for their service.

**STAFF**
- **Warden Cloudcroft** `Stern, Respected, Cunning Linguist` - Abbes Salvora visits often
- **Captain Kell** `Veteran, Strict, Proud`
- 6 workers; 6 human guards; 9 Jailers

**NOTABLE INMATES**
- **Jailers** spectral guardians; scorched amber runes cover their ethereal forms, burning brighter with rage; their touch summons painful astral shackles
- **The Hag Kalg** `Fae, Cruel, Patient` - whispers to dragon-shaped shadows
- **The Lost Druid** `Prophet, Elegant, Scheming` - was once recorded as Elara Moonshadow in Mon's intake documents, though she refuses to acknowledge this name. The guards whisper that she appeared at the prison gates willingly, carrying only a staff made of twisted driftwood and smiling like one who knows a secret.
- **Gavric the Silent** `Assassin, Mute, Watching`
- **Lady Vale** `Noble, Beautiful, Mad` - ate her entire family at a feast
- **Brother Ash** `Monk, Burnt, Faithful` - fire cleanses sin
- **The Twins** `Connected, Amplifying, Dangerous` - are kept in separate wings

**0306 Resin Grove** Trees bleed a luminescent amber resin into carefully placed glass catches—bathing the grove with soft amber light. The resin is of great value to alchemists and night travelers.

**0307 Border Lands** Sand and forest mingle uneasily. Fae and Dustfolk are both touched by mysticism but share little else. A massive tree straddles the border, its branches heavy with trinkets from both peoples—silver threads, carved stones, glowing talismans. A single fae and a single nomad stand watch, motionless. Each tracking the other's breath, neither blinking. Replacements come at precise intervals; to falter means surrender.

**0308 Hidden Cove** Smooth stones line a sheltered inlet, arranged too precisely to be natural. Grass-covered foothills hide the beach from casual view. A massive rib bone from an ancient kraken rises from the sand, bleached white and larger than a ship's mast.

**0310 The Bone Cairn** A massive pile of bones arranged in the shape of a cairn rises from the dunes. If toppled, the bones inexplicably restack themselves at twilight. Some bones shift position even when the cairn stands undisturbed, and locals swear the arrangement changes with the phases of the moon.

At the cairn's base, the sand is always cool to touch despite the desert heat. The bones themselves are sun-bleached but unmarked by weather or age—no one has identified what manner of creatures they came from.

**0401 Impossible Peaks** Mountain fangs rip the sky. No path exists; only shear stone.

**0402 Lost Druid's Threshold** Tall grass ripples in patterns no wind could shape. Standing stones peek through the green, their edges worn smooth. Something watches from beyond sight.

**0403 Mountain's Spine** Sheer rock walls split by a single path—no wider than a goat in many places. Stones feel warm to the touch, despite the altitude.

**0404 Stone Spine** Razor-backed ridges thrust toward the sky. Wind screams through its granite teeth. A single vulture circles but there is little to die in a place where nothing can live.

**0405 Freemoon Glade** Silver-leafed trees lean in tight circles. Pale flowers pulse with inner light. Shadows move when nothing casts them.

**0406 Ruined Shrine** Three weathered stone pillars rise from marshy ground—all that remains of a small temple. Rusted weapons hang from each pillar, swaying in the breeze. A leather pouch lies half-buried nearby.

**0407 Aware Wolf** Buzzards circle a half-eaten goat wearing a silver bell (6s). Nearby, a naked slender man with dark curly hair sleeps in a thicket, his body splattered with blood'. **Zander** (`Moonstruck, Charming, Haunted`) will claim to be searching for a lost dog. His pack only hunts at night. He speaks to a dead friend, Jack.

**0408 The Mirage Merchant** A caravan shifts appearance with each encounter—sometimes ornate, sometimes humble. The merchant gives random names and never looks the same twice. He or she sells trinkets claiming magical effects at twilight. The merchant's shape-changing amulet is real but only 1 in 6 of their wares are.

**0409 Wrecker's Cove** Jagged rocks tear at passing hulls. Splintered ship timbers litter the shore, tangled with salt-crusted rigging. A young boy perches on a driftwood stump, eyes fixed on the horizon. A copper whistle hangs ready—the signal that draws scavengers to fresh wreckage.

**0412 Isle of Wights** White berry bushes grow thick across the island, their milky fruit a tempting prize. The berries grant miraculous healing if eaten within the hour of picking—after that, they turn deadly. Dead birds litter the ground beneath the bushes, their feathers bleached chalk-white, berries still clutched in their beaks.

No undead haunt this isle, despite its name. Pirates spread that tale to protect their buried treasures, though the white-skinned corpses of unwary berry-seekers certainly helped sell the story. The occasional silver coin in the tide only strengthens local beliefs.

> **Treasure Seekers** The Bone Tree stands on the SE shore; a landmark known to mainland fishermen. Twice daily, stone steps emerge from the retreating tide, leading into the depths. Between two massive boulders lies a hidden chest—a prize for those quick enough to beat the returning tide.

**0501 The Chime Stones**
A narrow gorge where wind through stone formations creates haunting chimes. Seven engraved stones—each marked with a core emotion rune—rest near an empty indentation. Placing a stone transforms the gorge's resonance, shifting the feel of the landscape—and those within it—with its emotional tone.

**0502 Prophet for Profit** A makeshift shrine overlooks the coast where Tulver Witherspoon washed ashore. After being dead for nine minutes, he awoke a changed man; referring to himself as "The River"(`Charlatan, Corny, Ambitious`) and speaking of divine currents. His growing congregation of 42 followers camps nearby—seventeen wear the silver anchor of true believers. They will fight to the death for him.

The River studied briefly with the druids before charting his own course; a number of their sacred items still stowed safely away. Among his stolen treasures (old habits) is the **Nymph's Tear**, a teardrop gem originally belonging to the Fae Court. He preaches with a navigator's conviction, claiming to chart not just waters, but the courses of fate itself.

  d6 | He says shit like
:---:|:--------------------
 1   | "I've navigated the treacherous currents of fate. Call me 'The River' I flow with the wisdom of the ages."
 2   | "Feel my current, my power, swirling like the mighty river. I will chart your course."
 3   | "I'm the compass, guiding you through life's stormy waters."
 4   | "Aye, I once sailed the seas, but now I navigate the waters of the unknown."
 5   | "You don't want to know what lurks in those murky depths."
 6   | "As ebb and flow commands."

**0503 Contested Ground** A ritual site where druids and fae negotiate territorial boundaries. Massive stone discs, each carved with intricate treaties, balance on knife-edges. When wind passes, the discs rotate slightly—marking slow, centuries-long agreements about land use, magical rights, and natural boundaries. Some discs are cracked, others pristine—telling the story of past conflicts and current truces.

**0504 The Quiet Line** Where fae forest meets grassland, the earth trembles between cultivation and wild magic. Stunted trees cling to earth with desperate roots. Springtime bursts with medicinal herbs and wildflowers; autumn withers everything to ash. Druids and fae battle here not with weapons, but with the very soil itself—neither side winning, the land forever contested.

**0505 The Last Glade** A massive stone arch stands at the clearing's center, carved from a single piece of dark stone. No two people describe its carvings the same way—some see druidic runes, others fae symbols, some see nothing at all. Natural stone seats curve at its base. Those who sit and concentrate on a single question might glimpse its truth—though the answer rarely comes in the form expected.

**0506 Silent Dancer**
A faint, muffled melody lingers on the air. Closer inspection reveals dozens of footprints circling in the sand, endlessly overwriting themselves. A quiet voice asks, "Care to dance?" Any who reply “yes” (or anything similar) vanish from sight. The music swells—full and clear. A dozen elaborately dressed fae twirl and glide across the sand, celebrating the end of a drought and the birth of a child...

**0507 On The Road** A twisting path through the Twilight Sands, caught between mage order, fae whimsy, and the desert's will. No two journeys are the same. Time bends. Paths shift. The road takes what it wants—names, memories, years—but it's still the fastest way. Only those with magical protection or desperate purpose dare cross. Merchants pay enormous fees to fae guides and Yagul mages for safe passage. Talk to any local and they will tell you NOT to take that road. Flip a coin if they will tell you the "safer" path or lead you to highwaymen.

d6 | What Happens
:--:|:-------
1	| Swap shadows with another traveler. Yours follows their commands; theirs follows yours.
2	| Arrive at destination before you left. Memories of the journey feel like someone else's dream.
3	| Age or de-age by d6 years. No physical harm, just temporal confusion.
4	| Gain a fragment of a memory that isn't yours—but feels more real than your own experiences.
5	| Lose one random item. It's replaced by something from another traveler's past.
6	| Arrive with a vivid tattoo mapping a route you've never traveled. It changes weekly.

**0508 Oath Breakers**
A shallow cave nestles beneath a craggy cliff, thick vines concealing its entrance. Inside, a stone tablet bears the markings of countless broken promises—blood, sweat, and tears etched into weathered stone.

Those who swear an oath within this hollow find the words binding and treacherous. The air tastes of copper and regret. Only those with truly pure intentions may leave untainted.

------

**The Maidens Three**

On the harvest moon's shadowed cusp, the Maidens Three enacted a ritual of unmaking. Not with blade or blow, but with the alchemy of flesh, form, and flame. Gortha carved, Brielle kneaded, and Tuli consumed, transforming their father into something... other. By dawn, he was gone, his domains theirs. But their inheritance is more than land; it is a continuation...

**0601 The Bleeding Fields** These fields pulse with a morbid rhythm, constantly decaying and regenerating. Bone fragments erupt from the soil, then dissolve into grey dust. Any creature that dies here is instantly consumed and reshaped.

This is the domain of **Gortha** (`Butcher, Merciless, Dismantling`), who patrols these lands offering to "improve" visitors with her cleaver. Travelers find their wounds heal with unnatural speed, but each healing leaves a raised, pale scar.

**0602 The Proofing Grounds** A landscape of dough-like terrain that rises and falls with breath-like movements. Paths seem solid, then suddenly soften. Structures slump and reshape themselves in an endless cycle.

This is the domain of **Brielle** (`Baker, Consume, Creative`), who moves through the grounds leaving warm, doughy imprints. Travelers may find figures partially absorbed into the terrain, their voices muffled and desperate. Those who stay too long risk becoming ingredients in a recipe.

**0603 Both Ends** A suffocating heat hangs in the air. Everything is a wick—water boils into fire, stone melts into rivers, trees burst into silent conflagrations. The ground heaves in slow, rhythmic waves of combustion.

This is the domain of **Tuli** (`Candlestick Maker, Illuminating, Short Fuse`), whose presence ignites the very air. Creatures of living flame stalk the landscape, flickering. Each step leaves a trail of smoking, scorched earth.

------

**0604 The Shattered Altar** The broken remnants of an ancient altar. Shattered pillars—some larger than a man—lie scattered across the ground. At the center, a cracked stone slab is etched with strange markings. At night, **Shadows** (`Silent, Dreadful Presence, Corruptive Touch`) move across the stones, twisting into monstrous forms.

**0605 Mountain Pass** A narrow path slices between towering cliffs—the only route through Freemoon Forest's northern border. Two **Ginger Giants** (`Tossers, Snickering, Delightfully Cruel`) guard the pass, shoulders broader than the path itself. They demand a toll for crossing: something unique, not coin. Refuse, and boulders fly with impossible precision.

**0606 Shadow Walker** A robed woman sits cross-legged in sand, waiting for _just the right moment_. At any second she might spring up and step into a shadow, walking through a disorienting maze of darkness before emerging elsewhere—though never quite where intended. She might teach this art... _but at great cost_.

**0607 Runes in the Dunes** is a phenomenon that occurs at twilight. As the first light breaks over the horizon, intricate patterns like ancient runes emerge in the shifting sands. These patterns vary in complexity and design, appearing and disappearing with the rhythm of the sunrise. Locals believe these runes hold secrets or messages from the spirits of the desert. Others see them as a natural wonder, a testament to the enigma of the dunes. Regardless, witnessing the Runes in the Dunes is a captivating experience, drawing travelers and curious onlookers alike to behold the artistry of the desert dawn.

**0608 Yagul Fane** Two imposing towers—one obsidian black, one alabaster white—mark where legendary magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane made their home. The ground floors bustle with public markets, meeting halls, and apprentice quarters, while upper floors remain strictly warded off for magi-only.

The Council of Six governs with pragmatic efficiency, treating magical research like municipal planning. Magical "emissions" seep into surrounding lands almost accidentally—apprentices track regional transformations with bureaucratic indifference. They do not dictate how the Dustfolk engage with these changes, yet the Dustfolk have embraced them all the same, weaving the land’s shifting magic into their own understanding of the world.

A village of 300 Dustfolk surrounds the towers, their mix of tents and stone buildings testifying to their adaptability. They use minor enchantments as casually as other regions use tools.

The towers' reputation for magical mastery draws scholars from distant lands, but magic here is not spectacular—it's infrastructural, mundane, and quietly transformative.

The Council of Six governs from these towers, with Fellstead's head monk as tie-breaker.

**The Council of Six**
1. **Archmage Voss** `Chronomancer, Ancient, Calculating`
2. **Lady Meera** `Illusionist, Sarcastic, Teacher`
3. **Lord Thane** `Magical Duelist, Scarred, Stoic`
4. **Master Vex** `Shapeshifter, Disfigured, Kind`
5. **Sister Rose** `Druid, Oblivious, Funny` - Monastery representative
6. **[Empty Seat]** - Recently vacated under mysterious circumstances

- **Gareth** `Necromancer, Scoundrel, Sweet tooth` next in line for Council of 6
- **Captain Yorik** `Guard, Hunter, Daring`
- **The Broker** `Fence, Embroiderer, Methodical`
- **Narla** `Alchemist, Alluring, 3 Husbands`
- **Sorrel** `Priest, Trailblazer, Passionate`
- **Cirian** `Sage, Cartwright, Creative`
- **Flax** `Barkeep, Assassin, Cheap`
- **Liren** `Armorer, Wench, Determined`
- **Ursula** `Spy, Cheeky, Ward`
- **Mrs Redraven** `Lady-of-the-house, Loyal, Prude`

**RUMORS**
1. Master Vox is stuck between forms. He's actually a silver dragon studying human magic.
1. Sister Rose may wear monastery robes, but I saw her leaving offerings at the old druid stones.
1. The Broker's embroidery contains messages for northern spies.
1. Narla's three husbands? Same man; just from different times. Voss knows but lets it slide—he's sweet on her too.
1. Dustfolk children play 'Council and Criminals' in the alleys. They know secrets about the towers that even the guards don't know.
1. Watch which well you draw from. That east well water remembers things. Dreams them back to you at night.

**0609 Tide Markers** Massive driftwood totems, bleached white and carved with strange nautical symbols, stand half-buried in the sand. A path of worn cobblestones leads toward Yagul Fane.

**0701 Ebonchain's Caravan**
A shadowy caravan rolls across the land, appearing only to those in true need. No tracks mark its passage. Veiled drivers guide the silent wagons, led by **Lord Ebonchain** (`Regal, Gracious, Calculating Gaze`). He offers travelers sanctuary—with a catch. _"I expect you'll return the favor some day,"_ he says, invoking a binding fae contract. Decline and the caravan rolls on; accept and...

| d6 | Fae Favor |
|---|----------------------|
| 1 | You have a small, heavy package addressed to Yagul Fane. It has a wax seal and is marked "URGENT". Within is a dragon egg. |
| 2 | A silver leaf sigil of Lady Goodknight appears on your skin. Fae now react—some with respect, some with demands. |
| 3 | You have an emotional connection with trees. You cannot speak to them but you get a sense of what they're feeling.  |
| 4 | A wild animal, normally timid, fearlessly follows you, nudging your hand with its head as if seeking comfort. |
| 5 | You spit out the same rumor (roll on rumor table) over and over again, anytime someone says your name. |
| 6 | A contract with your signature, signed in silver, demands you return stolen fae artifact to the Fae Court. |

**0702 Mule Variations** A rutted path cuts through barren fields, marked by broken fence posts and bottles impaled on wooden stakes. A rusted plow stands abandoned, its harness ripped violently—as if something immensely strong suddenly broke free. The ground appears freshly tilled, yet nothing grows.

At night, shadowy laborers work the fields—moving in unison to an unheard song. Travelers who watch too long feel an inexplicable urge to join them, their shoulders feeling the weight of the yoke.

**0703 Silent Forge** A mute smith works an isolated forge, hammering an anvil without a sound. Weapons forged here never ring when drawn, armor swallows footsteps, and voices fade to a hush. Every tool bears an intricate rune of silence; craftsmen wear thick leather to guard against the forge’s muting power. Those who linger too long gradually lose their voices.

Commissions require payment in:
- An oath of silence.
- A personal item of sound (bell, wind chime, whistle).
- Enchanted materials.

**0704 The Crooked Saint** A shrine tilts against a gnarled tree. Within, a wooden idol contorted in a painful pose. Travelers who leave an offering wake to find an old injury healed—but a new, unfamiliar ache takes its place. The worse the offering, the harsher the trade. A missing finger for a mended leg, a deep scar for a broken tooth.

**0705 For Whom The Bell Tolls** A weathered stone tower crumbles at its base, a large bell hanging cracked from its peak. Its toll drifts across the sands, though no hand seems to strike it.

The Dustfolk believe the bell signals the arrival of a wandering ancestor, a spirit guiding the lost. Magi once charted magical currents by its ring; now it speaks only to those who listen.

**0706 The Shrine of Brine** A stone basin in the sand, its rim etched with curling fish. Fresh water fills it each dawn, transforming to brine by midday. Pilgrims kneel to wash their hands, pressing damp fingers to their tongues and muttering prayers for safe passage.

A rusted iron key lies beneath the water—visible yet unreachable. Grasping hands pass right through. The **Mad Monk** (`Seer, Unending Thirst, Ravings of Truth`) stole this key with a parlor trick, and it now hangs around his neck.

**0707 The First Stones** A vast stone formation hums with an odd, mechanical rhythm beneath the sands. The Dustfolk believe this is where the first ancestors were shaped, a sacred place where the desert itself first breathed.

They gather here to meditate, their spirits rising and falling with the pulse. The magi call it a natural anomaly, yet their own magic has amplified its rhythm over centuries. The Dustfolk do not resent this—they listen, adapting their rites to what the land has become.

**0708 The Saltwood** A salt-crusted forest clings to the coastline, its trees bleached and skeletal from years of sea spray. Some stand stark and lifeless, a ghostly tangle of bark and bone-white limbs. Others endure, their roots twisted deep into the briny earth, drinking from hidden springs.

The Dustfolk avoid this place—too much water too little sky. Magi have mapped strange currents in the air and soil, sensing something ancient woven into the salt and roots.

**0801 Stormridge** Mountain slopes lashed by wind and mist. The weather changes without warning—sudden storms, bitter cold. An uneasy path winds through crags, marked by forsaken campfires. A rotting corpse slumps against a tree, in a pool of dried blood. On his person, a finely crafted bow and rune-carved spear.

**0802 Vial Cart** A ruined watchtower overlooks a half-buried cart, bleached white by the sun. Empty, numbered vials and a tattered map to the Lost Druid's Grove rest inside. Faint markings on the vials suggest they must be filled in a precise order.

**0803 Forever Young** A landscape suspended in childhood's golden light. Trees grow in precise formations from a memory—each branch, each leaf positioned exactly as they were decades ago. Fragments of a child's toy occasionally peek through roots: a wooden soldier, a copper bell. Anyone entering the grove relives a single, vivid childhood memory—true or invented—so powerful it feels more real than their current life (based on a random tarot card). Leaving, they're unsure what was memory and what was illusion.

**0805 Classic Traveler** A tall man with a peculiar limp leads two impossibly strong oxen—Jake and Jim—pulling empty carts. **Malfas** (`Tall, Observer, Awkward`) is an alien in human form and the oxen are mechanical, which only cutting them would reveal. The traveler has 5 marbles that can perform what some would call miracles. He used one to make Jake, Jim and the cart. He needs one to return home. He's looking for work so he can study humans.

**0806 The Veil of Ash** A burnt haze engulfs the sands, the residue of an ancient ritual cast by Uma Fane herself. Apprentices toil daily to maintain the spectral barrier, knowing any disruption could release what lies dormant beneath the dunes.

The Dustfolk believe the haze separates the worlds of the living and the dead. Many gather to perform sacred rites, seeking guidance from ancestors. Though the magi insist they never intended it, the Dustfolk have grown attuned to the veil’s presence, sensing its power in ways even Yagul Fane does not fully understand.

**0807 Barrow of the Cane** A twelve-foot monolith of rust-colored stone, flecked with silver, rises from a hill of rusty grass. Ancient runes tell the history of **The Cane**, warrior tribes of old. Three weathered stones frame the barrow's entrance. Within, chalky paintings cover the walls—spear-wielding warriors with animal heads fighting monsters and mountain giants. Hand prints of men, women, and children mark the spaces between. Each cubbyhole bears images of these same animal spirits.

The cubbyholes hold bones alongside obsidian arrowheads, an obsidian axe, a silver bear idol (400s), and simple silver jewelry (120s). Several spear poles of exceptional quality remain, one still bearing its razor-sharp obsidian tip. Those who rest in this sacred space find their wounds heal faster.

If disturbed, the ghost of **Zamma** (`Shaman, Mute, Protector`)—the tribe's last shaman—appears. His bones rest beneath the monolith, just above the chamber ceiling. Though mute, he communicates by pointing to the wall paintings. He will not rest until the bones are returned to their rightful place. The Cane believed weapons were meant for use, but treasure belonged to the tribe. Those who steal (without trade or sacrifice) suffer their curse—flesh turning to rust, spreading from fingers to arm until death claims them.

**0902 Mountain Maw** A deep, spiraling chasm where the mountain meets the earth. Trees at its edge twist unnaturally, their roots exposed as if recoiling. The descent is perilous, the air thick with tension, and the silence overwhelming—until a distant scrape, low thud or eerie bellow breaks the stillness. Beast? Echo? Something else?

Scattered around the rim lie skeletons—warped, massive, unrecognizable. Monsters, every one. All slain in battle, yet no sign of what killed them. No human remains. No clear victor.

Few have climbed down. None have reached the bottom. Some call it a wound in the world, others a doorway.

**0904 Harlan's Grove** The region's finest hops grow in neat rows across rolling hills. Francis and Catherine Harlan, and their oldest son Dale (`Shrewd, Proud`), tend their crops with generations of expertise—though their success stems from more than skill alone. A rare mineral in the soil imbues their hops with distinctive flavors—a secret they guard as carefully as their harvests. Six workers tend the rows while monastery wagons collect their weekly barrels.

The Harlans supply most of their crop to Fellstead Monastery's brewery, though Maude's Meadery has always received a share. This year's harvest promises to be exceptional, despite their neighbor's failing hives.

**0906 Old Shepherd's Field** Stone foundations peek through tall grass, marking where Bellwick hamlet once stood. Shepherds still use the old stone pens, though Tam (`Weathered, Superstitious`) insists on proper etiquette when visiting. The ancient well remains reliable, but those who draw water always leave something in return.

**0907 Fare Fight** A copper-skinned warrior named **Lunara** (`Warrior, Proud, Suffers No Fools`) is fighting three armored traders; her broken spear lodged in one traders' shoulder, she now wields daggers. _Wandering hands were NOT part of the fare_. The traders' wagon is smoking and will soon go up in flames. Within the wagon are 300s of pelts and two casks of fine wine (200s).

**0908 Nettle’s Haven** This sprawling coastal compound has grown organically over decades. It began as a simple cottage but now blends herb gardens, meditation spaces, and other dwellings. The commune is a refuge where druids, monks, and wayward souls come together in peace. **Nettle** (`Matriarch, Insightful, Without Fear`) watches over it all; her sharp mind still guiding despite her fading vision. Her massive black dog, with a single silver eye, keeps a watchful eye on all who enter, wary of those with ill intent.

Work is shared—no one is turned away, but all must contribute. The walls are marked with symbols from both monastic and druidic traditions, a quiet testament to the sanctuary and survival found within.

**1001: Unkindness of Ravens:** Jagged peaks with numerous raven nests. One particular nest contains a pair of small, polished stones that reflect light in unique patterns. These are _message stones_, used to communicate over long distances.

**1004 Maude's Meadery** Vibrant wildflowers border a meandering stream, the air sweet with honey and herbs. The southwestern hives are empty now; their bees drawn to Harlan's Grove despite the distance. Those that return seem changed, producing bitter honey before dying. Maude (`Herbalist, Worried`) studies each fallen bee, unwilling to believe her old friends' hops could be the cause. Her storage barn holds dozens of honey barrels and mead casks, watched over by her foreman Burt (`Gruff, Loyal`).

**1007 Pilgrim's Hollow** A well-worn hollow where travelers pause before the final approach to Fellstead. A simple stone well and wooden shelter stand beside the path. Pilgrims have carved hundreds of prayers into the shelter's beams. Among them: "Lovely Lady Vale please spare us from your feast!"

**1009 Grappled Chapel** A dilapidated stone chapel strangled by **Dragon Vine** (`Grapple, Razor Sharp, Poison`)—their purple flowers oddly beautiful against crumbling walls. Empty crates rot in tangles of razor-sharp stems. The vines shift slightly in a wind that isn't there.

**1105 The Frostwake Grotto** A hidden cavern where the mountain's breath turns the air deathly cold. Even in summer, ice clings to the stone, and strange, pale flora thrive in the darkness. The deeper one goes, the more the ice seems… deliberate, as if shaped by unseen hands. In the very heart of the grotto stands a frozen pillar; something large trapped within. Whether it is a preserved guardian, a forgotten king, or something better left undisturbed—no one knows. Nightly harvesters leave behind clear signs: scattered ice fragments and deep cart ruts.

**1107 Weeping Grove** Mist clings to a dense stand of weeping trees. Everything drips with sickly-sweet water, even in drought. Rusted tools and broken barrels hint at abandoned collection efforts.

**1108 Fellstead Monastery** perches atop weathered cliffs, its honey-colored stone walls and Gothic spires silhouetted against the coastal sky. The monastery is adorned with intricate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of St. Fellstead (patron saint of seekers of knowledge). A trip of goats roams the terraced grounds, while sea caves beneath the brewery serve as naturally cool cellars for their renowned ale.

The monastery boasts a famed library, produces fine milk and cheese from their goats, and brews the best beer in the south—thanks to an annual donation of hops from Harlan's Grove [#0904].

A group of pilgrims has come from the north, placing additional strain on the monastery's resources and tranquility. They claim to seek guidance from St. Fellstead, but their behavior raises suspicions. Their leader, **Father Falen** (`Cutthroat, Apathetic`), has been seen snooping around the brewmaster’s office, asking unsettling questions about the monastery’s finances, and lingering in the library far too long. Some monks question their piety and wonder what they’re truly after.

**RESIDENTS**
- **Abbess Salvora** `Devoted, Respected, Distracted` - frequent visits to the Prison of Mon
- **Prior Cedric** `Rugged, Diligent, Insecure` - oversees brewing operations
- **Sister Elara** `Fallen Druid, Healer, Know-it-all`
- **Brother Ulfar** `Brewmaster, Mean Drunk` - avoided but knows his beer
- **Brother Estabar** `Monk, Eager, Gentle` - master goat herder
- **Sir Ealdred** `Knight, Daring, Haunted` - seeks spiritual clarity after long and brutal campaigns
- **Lady Isolde** `Noble, Graceful, Introspective` - sought sanctuary from the pressures of court life
- 24 Monks, 6 pilgrims

**1202 The Skyroot Sentinels** Towering, ancient trees grow impossibly tall here, their roots gripping stone as if holding the mountain in place. Legends claim these trees are guardians, awakened only when the land is threatened. Their bark is scarred with old battle wounds, and those who listen closely can hear faint warnings or welcomes, depending on the visitor’s intent.

**1203 The Broken Stair** A weathered stone staircase, half-swallowed by trees and moss, climbs partway up the mountainside before vanishing into ruin. No one knows who built it, but the air around it hums with a strange energy. Some believe it once led to a forgotten temple, while others suspect it was abandoned for good reason.

**1204 The Black Fangs** Jagged rock formations jut from the treeline like the teeth of some enormous beast. The stone is unnaturally dark, almost obsidian, and warm to the touch. Local hunters avoid the area, muttering about strange figures seen moving between the spires at dusk. Sometimes, a deep, reverberating hum can be heard from within the earth, like the growl of something waiting to rise.

**1205 The Hollow Roost** An immense tree clings to the mountainside, its trunk wide enough to house a small dwelling. Inside, the walls are lined with countless empty nests, though no birds have been seen here in generations. Instead, on certain nights, ghostly wings flicker through the air, and the wind carries the sound of distant, echoing caws. Those who sleep beneath the Roost report dreams of flying over endless forests—sometimes pleasant, sometimes nightmarish.

**1208 The Leaning Stones** Stone pillars, worn smooth by time, lean at impossible angles. Strange markings spiral up their sides. Even the monastery's goats avoid grazing among them, despite the unusually thick grass.

**1302 The Mistwell** A hidden spring high in the forest, perpetually cloaked in mist. Its water is clear but strangely heavy, and those who drink from it report vivid dreams—sometimes prophetic, sometimes terrifying.

**1303 The Slumbering Hart** Deep within the trees, where the land begins to rise, lies a clearing bathed in perpetual twilight. At its center rests an enormous stag—its antlers tangled with vines, its breath slow as the turning seasons. The creature does not wake, but its presence is undeniable. Druids and wanderers speak of it in hushed tones, calling it the Slumbering Hart, a guardian of balance. Disturbing it will summon the wrath of the forest itself.

**1306 Four Leaf Clover Field** A field of ONLY four leaf clovers... finding a THREE leaf clover brings the bearer luck.

**1308 Salted Woods** Gnarled pines grow right to the cliff's edge, their bark white with salt spray. A ship's wheel hangs forgotten in the branches, creaking in the wind. Fishermen leave offerings here—for luck on their next voyage. Fresh fish bones and a knotted red ribbon dangle from the spokes.

**1402 Red’s Woods** A winding path snakes through the forest, lined with hundreds of carved trees—each trunk a masterpiece, so lifelike they seem to breathe. At its heart stands a house built without a single nail, every joint seamlessly fitted. **"Red" Dressler** (`Tree-wise, Craftsman, Absorbed`) allows loggers to work to the south, but no axe may touch the trees of his woods. His face glows when he speaks of his wife and her garden, though few have ever glimpsed her among the trees—for she is a **Dryad** (`Ethereal, Elusive, Nurturing`). Those who appreciate true craftsmanship and respect the forest may find themselves invited to stay for supper.

**1403 Two Trees And Three Sisters** Two towering trees stand out among the many. These are the trees of the Eldest and Middle Sisters—their roots deep, bound to the forest. Not mere landmarks, they are the Sisters' power made flesh, the beating heart of the Starwoods.

The forest here is a labyrinth of tangled wards—shifting paths, serpentine thickets, and roots that coil around trespassers' ankles. Loggers are tolerated but watched, their axes never allowed to stray near sacred bark.

But the Hollow Sister's influence seeps through the soil, her saplings creeping ever closer. The Eldest and Middle whisper to the roots, listening for signs of intrusion, knowing that if their sister ever finds her way back, it may be too late.

> Three dryads as old as the Starwoods themselves. Not mere spirits, but the forest's living will. The Eldest and Middle rule with iron certainty, while the Hollow Sister has become something else entirely.

> **Eldest Sister** (`Hand of Judgement, Ruthless, The Root`) Stern and unwavering, she enforces the Starwoods' will with ruthless efficiency. The Hollow Sister is a threat to be eliminated.

> **Middle Sister** (`Watchful Eye, Composed, Leaves in the Wind`) Patient and watchful, she listens before she acts. Where the Eldest strikes, the Middle weighs the cost. She is the wind in the canopy, the feeling of being watched. She fears the Hollow Sister.

> **The Hollow Sister** (`Open Arms, Curious, The Heart`) Her tree’s roots torn from the earth by her own kin [#1505], yet she did not die. She befriended the fae, and her saplings grow strong in the Freemoon Forest. She waits…

**1404 Marked Woods** Massive old-growth pines worth a fortune in lumber. Loggers' marks show which trees to cut, but someone keeps moving them.

**1405 Loggers Camp** A rough collection of tents and wooden structures stands in stark contrast to the Starwood's eternal beauty. Axes and saws echo through the trees as loggers harvest the valuable timber. Even the most hardened logger feels the weight of their impact on these old woods, yet the work continues. The druids offer no aid against recent threats—to them, the loggers' presence is the true blight on their forest.

Boss hired a former druid to help navigate these tensions, but her true loyalties remain unclear. The camp's torches burn all night now, and no logger works alone.

> **The Sisters** remain silent; watching. They tolerate the loggers in the hope that their axes might cut down the Hollow Sister’s creeping saplings. They will turn on them the moment their purpose is served.

**CREW**
- **Foreman "Boss" Bartok** `Burly, Caring` - prioritizes crew safety over quotas
- **Nyssa "Thumbs" Dunsfold** `Fallen Druid, Witty` - hired to appease druids
- **Lena "Sawbones" Thorne** `Medic, Gentle` - treats wounds physical and spiritual
- **"Cookie"** `One-armed, Terrible cook` - lost his arm to "tree-bite"
- 12 loggers, each marked with protective symbols

**1407 Blackfish Point** A sheltered cove where prized blackfish school. Village fishermen claim the beach; their boats marked with crooked copper nails—wards from the Boat Hag. **"Cheeks" Allnut** (`Burly, Swift-Blade, Bear Hands`) _educates_ strangers that this is a private beach and that charter fees start at 100s; no haggling.

**1408 Fishing Hamlet** A handful of wooden huts cling to the coast, their weathered walls dark with salt spray.

The hut nearest the sea belongs to Pesh (`Generous, Paranoid`), a fourth-generation fisherman known for his anonymous donations to the monastery. None question how a simple fisherman can afford such charity. Beneath Pesh's hut lies a chest of 10,000 silver coins—salvaged from the pirate wreck in seven midnight diving trips. The weight of his secret is heavier than the chest.

The hamlet folk avoid the nearby Boat Hag [#1506], claiming her presence spoils their catches. Rotten fish regularly appear on her doorstep, though no one admits to leaving them.

**1503 Split Oak** A massive oak tree, split by siege engines during the battle, still stands - both halves alive and growing apart. Moss-covered stones from the war machines lie scattered at its base.

**1505 The Tree of the Hollow Sister** A massive oak, hollowed from within, its trunk split and blackened by decay. Its fall cursed the land. From here to the sea, trees stand withered, their roots severed, their bark peeling away. Yet, the Hollow Sister lives.

**1506 The Boat Hag** An overturned fishing boat serves as dwelling, its weathered hull grown thick with moss and marsh vines. Smoke from strange herbs seeps through the cracks while marsh birds deliver messages in exchange for scraps. Locals leave offerings at her door—they say rotten fish draws darker things away.

Among her treasures is the **Dryad's Whispering Branch**, _acquired_ from the Fae Court. It allows the wielder to communicate with woodland creatures and plants, though using it risks drawing attention from its former owner.

**1508 Pirate Shipwreck** lies just off the coast, its remains jutting from the water. Barnacles cling to its splintered boards, broken masts, and rusting cannons. Venomous reef snakes, camouflaged among the coral, hunt in the wreckage.

Among its treasures was a **Sylph Ring**—a pewter band marked with the fae rune for air that summons gentle winds. Carved on a board just above the waterline is "Pesh was here" [#1405].

**1601: The Bone-Wind Chimes:** Animal bones hang from dead trees, creating a haunting melody. The song tells the tale of the Battle of Mistwood. Disturb their precise arrangement, and the melody is lost—unsettling the fallen dead.

**1602 Mammoth Maw** A hillside splits open, revealing an enormous mammoth half-buried in swamp mud. Its gnarled tusks rise like fallen trees, fur matted and thick with decay.

The ground shifts subtly beneath its massive form, as though the creature still slumbers. The marsh hums with an ancient presence—the air growing dense, sweet with rot and forgotten blood. Some say it died in battle, others that the land itself caught it. Approach, and feel the creature's strange, silent pull.

**1603 Old Pete's Boggery** Wooden walkways wind through the marsh, connecting islands of relatively solid ground. **Pete** (`Weathered, Honest, Sharp`) and his twelve workers harvest peat from carefully managed bogs—fuel that keeps the region's hearths burning. The work is hard, but the marsh provides for those who know its ways.

Nobody knows these wetlands better than Pete and his daughter **Yde** (`Tomboy, Yearning, Hopeful`). They can name every pool, predict the weather by the reeds' sway, and find paths where others see only mire. Yde guides herb-seekers and the occasional northern merchant, while the purple bog orchids that grow near their operation fetch a fine price—though Pete never picks the ones with silver stems.

**1604 Silverline Point** Natural stone piers stretch into deep water where massive silverline bass school. The best fishing spot on the coast—half your catch goes to the marsh folk's community stew pot.

**1605 The Last Garden** A small cottage and garden somehow survive amid ash and char. Fresh vegetables still grow in tidy rows, untouched by blight. A scarecrow wearing a copper nail necklace stands watch. Ursula Mayfield (`Green-thumb, Aunt, Songbird`) tends the garden and shares her turnips with anyone who'll listen to her stories.

**1606 Dragon's Message** Scorched trees ooze black sap, their branches stripped bare. Massive claw marks score the cliffs. The Boat Hag's own skiff lies shattered on the rocks, her copper nails scattered in the sand.

**1703 Archer's Ridge** Steep cliffs where archers made their stand. Centuries of storms have exposed arrow shafts in the clay - all pointing to a lighthouse foundation that only shows at low tide.
