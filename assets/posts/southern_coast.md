**The Southern Coast**, despite its rugged terrain, enjoys a mild climate shaped by soft sea breezes and rolling coastal fog. Passage to the northern kingdoms is best conducted by sea, circumventing the Sorrow Mountains and the West Marshes. This land once served as a sacred druidic sanctuary until the Northern Kings, seeking an isolated location for their most notorious criminals, ordered the construction of a prison—or as they coldly declared, _"a place to throw our trash."_ To contain their prisoners through mystical means, they recruited the celebrated magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane. The crown also funded missionaries, ostensibly to support the prison's operations while attempting to convert the resident druids.

With these foundations of civilization now in place, the Southern Coast has begun to draw bold settlers eager to carve out new lives in this frontier.


### WHAT IS THIS?
The Southern Coast is a system-neutral, regional setting designed for sandbox exploration and adventure. Details are intentionally left vague to seamlessly integrate with YOUR campaign. The setting provides enough flavor to spark imagination while remaining flexible enough to use as-is. GMs are encouraged to modify or ignore content to best suit their table.


### SITUATIONS

2. Loggers in the Starwoods have been attacked by a creature they claim to be a wendigo. They've sent a desperate plea to the Monastery for aid.
1. The Crown's Fury, a ship lost in the Battle of Mistwood, was _bursting_ with treasure when it sank. The rumors of a "ghost ship" seen off the coast are well established but an eye witness swears that it's The Crown's Fury.
1. A local herbalist seeks brave adventurers to retrieve herbs that grow deep within the West Marshes, promising silver and potent potions as reward. He discreetly supplies the followers of both "The River" _and_ the Lost Druid. Neither party would be pleased if they knew about the other.
1. An infamous game hunter, and friend to the Northern Kings, will pay handsomely for help finding/tracking/killing a wendigo.
1. A Duke's son found a treasure map leading to the Isle of Wights and has not been heard from for a week. His last letter mentioned white berries that heal any wound.
1. A messenger from the Northern Kings needs safe passage to Yagul Fane. They're carrying sensitive documents about the royal funding of both institutions.
1. Lady Goodknight of the Fae Court demands the return of all fae artifacts; no exceptions. Generous rewards await those who comply.
1. The Prison of Mon is _quietly_ investigating why their binding runes are weakening. They suspect the Hag Kalg but it's actually the Lost Druid syphoning their power.
1. A Northern King's bastard is hiding among the Prophet's followers. Both assassins and royal agents are searching the mountains.
1. Maude's bees are dying and Harlan's famous hops are the likely cause. Both businesses are crucial to the Monastery's beer production.
1. Jailers report Hag Kalg whispering in an unknown language; prisoners in adjacent cells complain about dreams of a dark dragon.


### RUMORS

2. The Isle of Wights is aptly named. It's overrun with wights looking to add to their number. Nobody comes back from that wretched place.
1. Some crazy druid up in the mountains has got himself a harem and is performing miracles!
1. Yagul Fane is built atop an ancient city with unimaginable magical treasures (BYOD: _Bring Your Own Dungeon_).
1. Have you ever known purveyors of magic and religion to get along? There's tension between Yagul Fane and the monastery... count on it.
1. Greever's Lighthouse is full of ghosts. They sometimes activate the old light to summon a spectral ship from the depths.
1. The mountain mists are the breath of ancient dragons. Dragons ruled this place. The Lost Druid says they'll return once their food source is replenished.
1. Word is the Council of Six in Yagul Fane are trying to unseat the Fae Court; appointing "more cooperative" officials.
1. Maude's bees make special honey from Moonlight Mushrooms. The Monastery pays triple for those jars; say it helps 'em _see clearly_.
1. Fellstead's abbess and Mon's warden are friendly. VERY friendly if you know what I mean...
1. Watch for runes in the dunes. Nomads say they're portals at twilight. But careful! You might end up leagues away... or worse.
1. Some of those 'stones' in the Bone Cairn? Them's dragon eggs! That's why they move at night; they're getting ready to hatch.


### LOCATIONS

**Freemoon Forest** stretches westward along the South Sea and is home of many rare botanicals. Wildflowers scent the air and the wind resonates like a familiar melody. Mortals avoid this "Fae Land" whenever possible; those who cannot are wise to hire a guide to help with any Fae "curiosities". This is especially good advice should you find yourself a defendant in the Fae Court. The court's queen, **Lady Goodknight** (`Imperial, Prejudiced, Grandparent`), has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to protecting the forest and the secrets of Fae magic.

Stretches of forest lie burned to ash, creating an eerie beauty in the devastation. The pattern of destruction suggests a dragon, though none have been sighted... yet.

 2d6 | Freemoon Forest Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Shadow Dragon** An ancient dragon that is nearly indistinguishable from natural shadows. Only visible when breathing fire, at twilight, or when it wishes to be. It communes with the imprisoned Hag Kalg through shadow-speech.
 3   | 2d6 **Druid Followers** demand an offering.
 4   | d6+1 **Redcaps** If you see one, it's because they want you to or you're marked. Once they outnumber you, out come the razors. Fresh blood for their caps! These are getting drunk and throwing an axe at a mortal tied to a rotting stump. First one to "hit" loses. The more they drink the closer they get.
 5   | **Lamp Boy** A small figure with silver coins for eyes and a darkened brass lamp beckons silently for the party to follow. It has been commissioned by Lady Goodknight, to lead them to the Fae Court for judgment.
 6   | **Fae Court** The air shimmers and a court materializes around the party. They are immediately found guilty of stealing a fae trinket and banished from Freemoon Forest. Roll d6 for their task: <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><li>1-2: Return the Nymph's Tear from The River [0502] </li><li>3-4: Retrieve the Sylph Ring from the shipwreck [1508] </li><li>5-6: Recover the Dryad's Branch from the Boat Hag [1506]</li></ul>
 7   | **Sculpture Garden** with dozens of lifelike stone statues, including a mesmerizing medusa sculpture... reflected in a full length mirror just beside her.
 8   | **Wailing Trees** mournful cries echo through the ancient woods. Those who hear become despondent and have a 2 in 6 chance of sleeplessness from haunting nightmares that last d6 nights.
 9   | 3d6 **Moonlight Mushrooms**, a very rare and valuable fungi. If consumed, they offer visions of near future events, at the cost of a single sleepless night and pains from deep laughter.
 10  | **Enchanted Clearing** A perfect circle of glowing fae flowers. Their nectar grants visions but picking them risks the wrath of their caretaker: a dryad who trades fairly but punishes theft with eternal servitude.

**Twilight Sands** As day transitions into night, shifting dunes and pristine white grains shimmer with an incorporeal glow. This landscape presents a mystical spectacle where reality blurs and secrets are laid bare. Despite its brilliancy, the sand is surprisingly cold to the touch. But it reflects and amplifies the sun's rays with mesmerizing and blinding affect... perhaps _literally_ if gazing too long.

Nomadic tribes lay claim to certain areas, and conflicts over resources are not uncommon among them. They are quick to dismiss any hint of authority from Yagul Fane and their "wizzards".

 2d6 | Twilight Sands Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Sandits** submerge a triangular stone in water, unleashing a localized sandstorm. They attack in the blinding chaos; appearing from seemingly nowhere (using rune stones). More water creates larger storms, from "stinging eyes" to "buried alive".
 3   | 2d6 **Dune Crawlers** Large, insect-like creatures that scuttle effortlessly over sands. They burrow just under the sand wait to strike...
 4   | d6 **Dust Devils** Your weapons are useless against these whirling tornadoes of sand. They drain moisture from living things, leaving victims parched and weakened. The only defense is to lie flat or find solid cover—fighting just feeds their winds.
 5   | **Ghost Caravan**, half-buried remnants of a merchant caravan. Among the weathered wagons: spice barrels (still fragrant), bolts of silk (perfectly preserved), and brass-bound chests. The ghostly merchants defend their cargo; still hoping to complete their delivery to Yagul Fane.
 6 | **Trapped Dybbuk** A spirit trapped in an ornate silver cage, unable to possess the living. She has a letter containing an ancient possession ritual. If the party delivers this letter to someone of their choosing, she will share the victim's wealth once possessed.
 7   | **Rune Stone** a weathered stone that transports anyone touching it to its twin in an adjacent hex (d6: 6=North, continuing clockwise) during twilight (1 hour at dusk/dawn). This is the secret to the Sandits appearing from nowhere and they will kill to protect it. The stones are typically half-buried in sand and easily overlooked.
 8   | **Lost Mage** asks the party how to get back to Yagul Fane without admitting the he is lost.
 9   | **Nomadic Tribe** Know the sands better than you know your home. Their hospitality is legendary, their vengeance more so. They may trade information in exchange for assistance in fending off Sandits.
 10  | **Oasis Mirage**, a cache of valuable relics hidden beneath the shimmering surface of water. Grasping at them yields only sand. Twilight reveals the truth: they are just a reflection; the real pool floats inverted twenty feet above.

**The Sorrow Mountains** divide the eastern Starwoods from the Freemoon Forest to the west. The moniker derives from the perpetual mist that shrouds their rugged peaks. Within their depths lies the Prison of Mon. Visitors speak of a palpable sense of foreboding and the feeling of unseen eyes peering into their very soul.

 2d6 | Sorrow Mountains Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | d6 **Bears** deceptively quick for their size. Their burst speed and reach catch most prey off guard. You'll only underestimate them once.
 3   | 2d6 **Wolves** hunt with cunning and keen senses. Their pack mentality means you're likely surrounded before you know it. You might want to stay close to a fire... or a spear.
 4   | A recent **Landslide** blocks the way ahead, requiring detour or clearing
 5   | **Lamp Boy** A small figure with silver coins for eyes and a darkened brass lamp beckons silently for the party to follow. It has been commissioned by prison officials. Those bearing proper prison documents or official business are led safely to Mon's gates. Others... directly to the Jailers.
 6   | **Abandoned Campsite** with scattered belongings, bloodstains, and tracks leading into a copse of trees. Embers still smoke in the fire pit.
 7   | **Fighting Giants** duel with boulder, echoing like thunder through the mountains. One takes a devastating hit to the knee; his roar of pain shaking the valley. The winner's prize remains to be seen.
 8 | **A Flock of Goats** bleat and traverse the steep cliffs with amazing ease. Their bells are pure silver, and their herder is suspiciously absent.
 9   | **A Distressed Griffon** caught in a bear trap, its proud head thrashing in pain. Voices approach from the distance—likely the poachers who set the trap. Time for a choice.
 10  | **Waterfall Pool** reveals scattered silver coins shimmering from beneath 20' of freezing water
 11+ | No encounter

**Starwoods** An ancient forest nestled along the coast, where tangled briars and gnarled roots clutch the dirt like fingers. A dense canopy diffuses sunlight, casting a mesmerizing play of light and shadow upon the forest floor. Towering behemoths, prized for their unmatched durability, dominate the landscape and fetch a handsome price.

Legend speaks of a guardian of the woods—a creature part beast and part spirit—rumored to possess an insatiable hunger for human flesh.

 2d6 | Starwoods Encounters
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | **Wendigo** Air turns bitter cold as it wind-walks between visible locations. Bites that draw blood infect the victim with insatiable hunger. They will devour all the food on their person... then they will attempt to eat a person and eventually become a Wendigo themselves.
 3   | **Bristled Boars** Seething with inexplicable rage, these shaggy beasts charge without provocation. Their razor tusks and surprising speed make them far more dangerous than common swine.
 4   | **Succubi** with their alluring features framed by cascading locks of midnight hair, weave a hypnotic song laced with secrets of the forest. Those willing to bargain trade in years of their future. Those who don't might still lose a few weeks to a _stolen kiss_.
 5 | **Giant Copper Scale** A massive copper balance bears fae markings. A star stone (fae currency) perfectly counterweights an iron ring—an uneasy truce between realms. Disturbing this balance transforms the surrounding forest, favoring either fae glamour or mortal steel.
 6 | **Treant** Bark bearing the scars of countless axes, this ancient guardian blocks the way. Those carrying axes or open flame face immediate hostility. Otherwise, it presents three acorns: to plant, to eat, to crush. The choices reveal the party's heart to the watching woods.
 7 | **Lost Path** The path ahead literally shifts; trees and undergrowth rearrange themselves before your eyes. The forest's message is clear: you are not welcome this way.
 8   | **Voodoo Dolls** one for each party member, carefully posed upon the forest floor. They're crude but the resemblance is unsettling. Someone has been watching the party long enough to capture their likenesses.
 9   | **Mad Monk** (see Hextras)
 10  | **Ancient Shrine** Carved into an ancient white oak, the shrine holds silver rings; one for each party member, etched with their name. Taking them feels both invited and ominous.
 11+ | No encounter

**West Marshes** sprawl endlessly along the eastern shore—a labyrinth of murky waters and treacherous bogs. Despite their confusing name, these swamps are home to quicksand pits and giant leeches slithering through the muck. The scent of damp earth and rotting vegetation chokes the air. Rare herbs and exotic flora thrive in these fertile soils, coveted by herbalists and alchemists alike.

 2d6 | West Marshes
:---:|:--------------------
 2   | d6 **Bog Trolls** Mossy brutes rise from the muck to ambush prey. Their putrid breath is so foul it requires a save to avoid retching. They hate Marsh Tea's scent and actively seek to destroy it.
 3   | d6 **Swamp Drakes** Flying crocodilian wyrms that snatch prey from above and drag them to underwater lairs. Their wingbeats temporarily part the marsh waters, revealing sunken treasures... and dangers.
 4 | **Mistwood Fallen** 3d6 zombies in rotting military garb, still fighting the Battle of Mistwood. They mistake any armed group for the enemy, but ignore those carrying King Theric's silver stag banner.
 5   | **Quicksand** What is it that's not exactly water and it ain't exactly earth?
 6   | **Bog Myrtle** small shrubs with berries prized for flavoring alcoholic beverages and as an essential oil. Bog Trolls often lurk near productive patches.
 7   | **Marsh Tea** a flowering plant used to treat various ailments, valuable to apothecaries. Collecting it requires wading into deep water where Swamp Drakes hunt.
 8   | **Bog Rosemary** an extremely rare evergreen producing pink flowers essential for healing potions. It only blooms at night and its glow attracts attention.
 9   | **Bog Amber** fossilized tree resin, prized for its beauty and rarity. Some may contain preserved fairy lights, worth much more to Yagul Fane than regular amber. Usually found in Quicksand.
 10 | **Battle Bounty** A heavy chest (2000s, 125lbs) marked with King Theric II's silver stag. The zombies nearby seem to be guarding it rather than attacking.
 11+ | No encounter


### HEXES

**0104 Shadow Dragon Lair** The entrance is obscured by shifting shadows cast by bioluminescent fungi, which dimly illuminate the cave. The shadows are nearly indistinguishable from the dragon itself.

The Hag Kalg found this dragon dying before her imprisonment in Mon. Nursing it back to health forged an everlasting bond. The two now communicate via shadows, plotting her freedom.

**0209 Greever's Lighthouse** stands weather-beaten, like a skeletal finger pointing to the heavens. Constructed by Ned Greever, whose wife, Ida (`Lovelorn, Vengeful`), met her end by jumping to the cliffs below. Since then, the abandoned lighthouse draws "grievers" who choose a similar fate. All who enter feel a heavy, chilling presence and a lingering sorrow.

The fourth floor still holds Ida Greever's bed; her diary hidden beneath. In it, she writes of her true love—the captain of The Crown's Fury. The day she learned his ship was lost in the Battle of Mistwood, she leapt from the tower. Now she and other lost souls light the beacon, calling the ghost ship from the depths.

Ida's diary contains a page ripped from a ships log. It reads: _"Curse those berries—lost two more men this week. But the silver sleeps safe beneath the Bone Tree. Only the tide knows the way."_ see [0412].

On the cliff's edge, purple bog orchids fade in an ancient bouquet. Its card reads "My dearest Ida, Your favorite color. I will always love you, Peter".

**Ghost** `Incorporeal, Obsessed, Tragic`—Each bound to this world by unfinished business. Some don't know they're dead. Some do and are very angry about it.

**0302 Lost Druid's Grove** lies nestled amidst the craggy embrace of the Sorrow Mountains. Weathered stone circles show signs of countless ceremonies. Thirteen followers maintain sacred rites despite their leader's imprisonment in Mon. They tolerate respectful visitors to the grove but ceremony days are _strictly_ private.

Ancient runes, similar to those binding Mon's prisoners, are carved into the stones. The circles' placement mirrors the prison's cell layout, though this could be coincidence. Complex chalk markings cover the stones and ground between them, redrawn daily in precise patterns. At night, amber light moves between the marks, though its source remains unclear.

At the grove's heart stands an altar stone—black as pitch and cold to touch. Thirteen hand-prints are burned deep into its surface, each glowing with a faint amber light.

**0305 Prison of Mon** A fortress carved into the Sorrow Mountains, its walls blend seamlessly into the face of the mountain. Dark, damp cells stretch deep within, each lit by a single torch. Prisoners wear runed chains that bind them to their sentences—even death offers no release. Prisoners that die during their incarceration serve the remainder of their sentence as a Jailer.

The ethereal Jailers were once prisoners themselves. They stand eternal watch in the long entrance hall, attuned to truth. Any deception triggers harsh response.

Yagul Fane maintains the binding runes while Fellstead Monastery provides rotating monks, food, and care. Both receive _royal endowments_ from northern kings for their service.

**STAFF**
- **Warden Cloudcroft** `Stern, Respected, Cunning Linguist` - Abbes Salvora visits often
- **Captain Kell** `Veteran, Strict, Proud`
- 6 workers; 6 human guards; 9 Jailers

**NOTABLE INMATES**
- **Jailers** spectral guardians; scorched amber runes cover their ethereal forms, burning brighter with rage; their touch summons painful astral shackles
- **The Hag Kalg** `Fae, Cruel, Patient` - whispers to dragon-shaped shadows
- **The Lost Druid** `Prophet, Elegant, Scheming` - was once recorded as Elara Moonshadow in Mon's intake documents, though she refuses to acknowledge this name. The guards whisper that she appeared at the prison gates willingly, carrying only a staff made of twisted driftwood and smiling like one who knows a secret.
- **Gavric the Silent** `Assassin, Mute, Watching`
- **Lady Vale** `Noble, Beautiful, Mad` - ate her entire family at a feast
- **Brother Ash** `Monk, Burnt, Faithful` - fire cleanses sin
- **The Twins** `Connected, Amplifying, Dangerous` - are kept in separate wings

**0310 The Bone Cairn** A massive pile of bones arranged in the shape of a cairn rises from the dunes. If toppled, the bones inexplicably restack themselves at twilight. Some bones shift position even when the cairn stands undisturbed, and locals swear the arrangement changes with the phases of the moon.

At the cairn's base, the sand is always cool to touch despite the desert heat. The bones themselves are sun-bleached but unmarked by weather or age—no one has identified what manner of creatures they came from.

**0408.1 The Mirage Merchant** A caravan shifts appearance with each encounter—sometimes ornate, sometimes humble. The merchant gives random names and never looks the same twice. He or she sells trinkets claiming magical effects at twilight. The merchant's shape-changing amulet is real but only 1 in 6 of their wares are.

**0412 Isle of Wights** White berry bushes grow thick across the island, their milky fruit a tempting prize. The berries grant miraculous healing if eaten within the hour of picking—after that, they turn deadly. Dead birds litter the ground beneath the bushes, their feathers bleached chalk-white, berries still clutched in their beaks.

No undead haunt this isle, despite its name. Pirates spread that tale to protect their buried treasures, though the white-skinned corpses of unwary berry-seekers certainly helped sell the story. The occasional silver coin in the tide only strengthens local beliefs.

> **Treasure Seekers** The Bone Tree stands on the SE shore; a landmark known to mainland fishermen. Twice daily, stone steps emerge from the retreating tide, leading into the depths. Between two massive boulders lies a hidden chest—a prize for those quick enough to beat the returning waters.

**0502 Prophet for Profit** A makeshift shrine overlooks the coast where Tulver Witherspoon washed ashore. After being dead for nine minutes, he awoke a changed man; referring to himself as "The River"(`Charlatan, Corny, Ambitious`) and speaking of divine currents. His growing congregation of 42 followers camps nearby—seventeen wear the silver anchor of true believers. They will fight to the death for him.

The River studied briefly with the druids before charting his own course; a number of their sacred items still stowed safely away. Among his stolen treasures (old habits) is the **Nymph's Tear**, a teardrop gem originally belonging to the Fae Court. He preaches with a navigator's conviction, claiming to chart not just waters, but the courses of fate itself.

  d6 | He says shit like
:---:|:--------------------
 1   | "I've navigated the treacherous currents of fate. Call me 'The River' I flow with the wisdom of the ages."
 2   | "Feel my current, my power, swirling like the mighty river. I will chart your course."
 3   | "I'm the compass, guiding you through life's stormy waters."
 4   | "Aye, I once sailed the seas, but now I navigate the waters of the unknown."
 5   | "You don't want to know what lurks in those murky depths."
 6   | "As ebb and flow commands."

**0607 Runes in the Dunes** is a phenomenon that occurs at twilight. As the first light breaks over the horizon, intricate patterns like ancient runes emerge in the shifting sands. These patterns vary in complexity and design, appearing and disappearing with the rhythm of the sunrise. Locals believe these runes hold secrets or messages from the spirits of the desert. Others see them as a natural wonder, a testament to the enigma of the dunes. Regardless, witnessing the Runes in the Dunes is a captivating experience, drawing travelers and curious onlookers alike to behold the artistry of the desert dawn.

**0608 Yagul Fane** Two imposing towers—one obsidian black, one alabaster white—mark where legendary magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane made their home. The Council of Six governs from these towers, with Fellstead's head monk as tie-breaker. Ground floors bustle with public markets, meeting halls, and apprentice quarters, while upper floors remain strictly warded against all but magi and staff. The towers' reputation for magical mastery draws scholars and adventurers from distant lands.

A village of 300 Dustfolk surrounds the towers, their mix of tents and stone buildings testifying to their adaptability. These hardy folk maintain traditional values while embracing the harsh desert life.

At the village center, a magical cistern ensures water for all—a gift from the towers that symbolizes unity between magi and Dustfolk. The villagers tend livestock and maintain active trade despite their remote location.

**The Council of Six**
1. **Archmage Voss** `Chronomancer, Ancient, Calculating`
2. **Lady Meera** `Illusionist, Sarcastic, Teacher`
3. **Lord Thane** `Magical Duelist, Scarred, Stoic`
4. **Master Vex** `Shapeshifter, Disfigured, Kind`
5. **Sister Rose** `Druid, Oblivious, Funny` - Monastery representative
6. **[Empty Seat]** - Recently vacated under mysterious circumstances

- **Gareth** `Necromancer, Scoundrel, Sweet tooth` next in line for Council of 6
- **Captain Yorik** `Guard, Hunter, Daring`
- **The Broker** `Fence, Embroiderer, Methodical`
- **Narla** `Alchemist, Alluring, 3 Husbands`
- **Sorrel** `Priest, Trailblazer, Passionate`
- **Cirian** `Sage, Cartwright, Creative`
- **Flax** `Barkeep, Assassin, Cheap`
- **Liren** `Armorer, Wench, Determined`
- **Ursula** `Spy, Cheeky, Ward`
- **Mrs Redraven** `Lady-of-the-house, Loyal, Prude`

**RUMORS**
1. Master Vox is stuck between forms. He's actually a silver dragon studying human magic.
1. Sister Rose may wear monastery robes, but I saw her leaving offerings at the old druid stones.
1. The Broker's embroidery contains messages for northern spies.
1. Narla's three husbands? Same man; just from different times. Voss knows but lets it slide—he's sweet on her too.
1. Dustfolk children play 'Council and Criminals' in the alleys. They know secrets about the towers that even the guards don't know.
1. Watch which well you draw from. That east well water remembers things. Dreams them back to you at night.

**0807.6 Barrow of the Cane** A twelve-foot monolith of rust-colored stone, flecked with silver, rises from a hill of rusty grass. Ancient runes tell the history of **The Cane**, warrior tribes of old. Three weathered stones frame the barrow's entrance. Within, chalky paintings cover the walls—spear-wielding warriors with animal heads fighting monsters and mountain giants. Hand prints of men, women, and children mark the spaces between. Each cubbyhole bears images of these same animal spirits.

The cubbyholes hold bones alongside obsidian arrowheads, an obsidian axe, a silver bear idol (400s), and simple silver jewelry (120s). Several spear poles of exceptional quality remain, one still bearing its razor-sharp obsidian tip. Those who rest in this sacred space find their wounds heal faster.

If disturbed, the ghost of **Zamma**—the tribe's last shaman—appears. His bones rest beneath the monolith, just above the chamber ceiling. Though mute, he communicates by pointing to the wall paintings. He will not rest until the bones are returned to their rightful place. The Cane believed weapons were meant for use, but treasure belonged to the tribe. Those who steal (without trade or sacrifice) suffer their curse—flesh turning to rust, spreading from fingers to arm until death claims them.

**0904 Harlan's Grove** The region's finest hops grow in neat rows across rolling hills. Francis and Catherine Harlan, and their oldest son Dale (`Shrewd, Proud`), tend their crops with generations of expertise—though their success stems from more than skill alone. A rare mineral in the soil imbues their hops with distinctive flavors—a secret they guard as carefully as their harvests. Six workers tend the rows while monastery wagons collect their weekly barrels.

The Harlans supply most of their crop to Fellstead Monastery's brewery, though Maude's Meadery has always received a share. This year's harvest promises to be exceptional, despite their neighbor's failing hives.

**1004 Maude's Meadery** Vibrant wildflowers border a meandering stream, the air sweet with honey and herbs. The southwestern hives are empty now; their bees drawn to Harlan's Grove despite the distance. Those that return seem changed, producing bitter honey before dying. Maude (`Herbalist, Worried`) studies each fallen bee, unwilling to believe her old friends' hops could be the cause. Her storage barn holds dozens of honey barrels and mead casks, watched over by her foreman Burt (`Gruff, Loyal`).

**1108 Fellstead Monastery** perches atop weathered cliffs, its honey-colored stone walls and Gothic spires silhouetted against the coastal sky. The monastery is adorned with intricate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of St. Fellstead (patron saint of seekers of knowledge). A trip of goats roams the terraced grounds, while sea caves beneath the brewery serve as naturally cool cellars for their renowned ale.

The monastery boasts a famed library, produces fine milk and cheese from their goats, and brews the best beer in the south—thanks to an annual donation of hops from Harlan's Grove [#0904].

A group of pilgrims has come from the north, placing additional strain on the monastery's resources and tranquility. They claim to seek guidance from St. Fellstead, but their behavior raises suspicions. Their leader, **Father Falen** (`Cutthroat, Apathetic`), has been seen snooping around the brewmaster’s office, asking unsettling questions about the monastery’s finances, and lingering in the library far too long. Some monks question their piety and wonder what they’re truly after.

**RESIDENTS**
- **Abbes Salvora** `Devoted, Respected, Distracted` - frequent visits to the Prison of Mon
- **Prior Cedric** `Rugged, Diligent, Insecure` - oversees brewing operations
- **Sister Elara** `Fallen Druid, Healer, Know-it-all`
- **Brother Ulfar** `Brewmaster, Mean Drunk` - avoided but knows beer
- **Brother Estabar** `Monk, Eager, Gentle` - master goat herder
- **Sir Ealdred** `Knight, Daring, Haunted` - seeks spiritual clarity after long and brutal campaigns
- **Lady Isolde** `Noble, Graceful, Introspective` - sought sanctuary from the pressures of court life
- 24 Monks, 6 pilgrims

**1405 Loggers Camp** A rough collection of tents and wooden structures stands in stark contrast to the Starwood's ancient beauty. Axes and saws echo through the trees as loggers harvest the valuable timber. Even the most hardened logger feels the weight of their impact on these old woods, yet the work continues. The druids offer no aid against recent threats—to them, the loggers' presence is the true blight on their forest.

Boss hired a former druid to help navigate these tensions, but her true loyalties remain unclear. The camp's torches burn all night now, and no logger works alone.

**CREW**
- **Foreman "Boss" Bartok** `Burly, Caring` - prioritizes crew safety over quotas
- **Nyssa "Thumbs" Dunsfold** `Fallen Druid, Witty` - hired to appease druids
- **Lena "Sawbones" Thorne** `Medic, Gentle` - treats wounds physical and spiritual
- **"Cookie"** `One-armed, Terrible cook` - lost his arm to "tree-bite"
- 12 loggers, each marked with protective symbols

**1408 Fishing Hamlet** A handful of wooden huts cling to the coast, their weathered walls dark with salt spray.

The hut nearest the sea belongs to Pesh (`Generous, Paranoid`), a fourth-generation fisherman known for his anonymous donations to the monastery. None question how a simple fisherman can afford such charity. Beneath Pesh's hut lies a chest of 10,000 silver coins—salvaged from the pirate wreck in seven midnight diving trips. The weight of his secret is heavier than the chest.

The hamlet folk avoid the nearby Boat Hag [1506], claiming her presence spoils their catches. Rotten fish regularly appear on her doorstep, though no one admits to leaving them.

**1506 The Boat Hag** An overturned fishing boat serves as dwelling, its weathered hull grown thick with moss and marsh vines. Smoke from strange herbs seeps through the cracks while marsh birds deliver messages in exchange for scraps. Locals leave offerings at her door—they say rotten fish draws darker things away.

Among her treasures is the **Dryad's Whispering Branch**, _acquired_ from the Fae Court. It allows the wielder to communicate with woodland creatures and plants, though using it risks drawing attention from its former owner.

**1508 Pirate Shipwreck** lies just off the coast, its remains jutting from the water. Barnacles cling to its splintered boards, broken masts, and rusting cannons. Venomous reef snakes, camouflaged among the coral, hunt in the wreckage.

Among its treasures was a **Sylph Ring**—a pewter band marked with the fae rune for air that summons gentle winds. Carved on a board just above the waterline is "Pesh was here" [#1405].

**1603 Old Pete's Boggery** Wooden walkways wind through the marsh, connecting islands of relatively solid ground. **Pete** (`Weathered, Honest, Sharp`) and his twelve workers harvest peat from carefully managed bogs—fuel that keeps the region's hearths burning. The work is hard, but the marsh provides for those who know its ways.

Nobody knows these wetlands better than Pete and his daughter **Yde** (`Tomboy, Yearning, Hopeful`). They can name every pool, predict the weather by the reeds' sway, and find paths where others see only mire. Yde guides herb-seekers and the occasional northern merchant, while the purple bog orchids that grow near their operation fetch a fine price—though Pete never picks the ones with silver stems.


### HEXTRAS

The following hex/encounters can be used as random situations throughout the Southern Coast as the GM requires.

1. **Shadow Walker** A robed woman sits cross-legged in sand, waiting for the right moment. At any second she might spring up and step into a shadow, walking through a disorienting maze of darkness before emerging elsewhere—though never quite where intended. She might teach this art... _but it will cost_.

1. **Classic Traveler** A tall man with a peculiar limp leads two impossibly strong oxen—Jake and Jim—pulling empty carts. **Malfas** (`Tall, Observer, Awkward`) is an alien in human form and the oxen are mechanical, which only cutting them would reveal. The traveler has 5 marbles that can perform what some would call miracles. He used one to make Jake, Jim and the cart. He needs one to return home. He's looking for work but really wants to study humans.

1. **Mad Monk** A figure in impossibly pink robes stumbles forward from nowhere. His eyes dart with a manic glint and he mumbles to himself incoherently. He will ask the PCs if they can spare any water. He's quite mad... and looking for a door. He might remember his name is **Jaral**.

1. **Four Leaf Clover Field** A field of ONLY four leaf clovers... finding a THREE leaf clover brings the bearer luck.

1. **Aware Wolf** Buzzards circle a half-eaten goat wearing a silver bell (6s). Nearby, a naked slender man with dark curly hair sleeps in a thicket, his body splattered with blood'. **Zander** (`Friendly, Haunted`) will claim to be searching for a lost dog. His pack only hunts at night. He speaks to a dead friend.

6. **Fare Fight** A copper-skinned warrior named **Lunara** (`Warrior, Proud, Suffers No Fools`) is fighting three armored traders; her broken spear lodged in one traders' shoulder, she now wields daggers. _Wandering hands were NOT part of the fare_. The traders' wagon is smoking and will soon go up in flames. Within the wagon are 300s of pelts and two casks of fine wine (200s).
