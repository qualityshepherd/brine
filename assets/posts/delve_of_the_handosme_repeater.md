I like adventure modules. I especially like the newer ones... that are _actually_ modular. Short, open-ended adventures that are trivial to drop into any campaign. Scanable; easy to grok. This is thankfully becoming the norm; fighting against the epic walls-of-text, and endless lore from modules of yore. This is what I want and what _I want to write_.

Thus, [Delve of the Handsome Repeater](https://casadeocio.itch.io/delve-of-the-handsome-repeater) was born. This is my _hat_ tossed into the ring of an ever-growing list of newer adventures.

To be honest: I find dungeons and dungeon crawls boring; mega dungeons _mega_ boring. So it's only fitting that my first published module (more or less) should be a dungeon ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I hoped writing one would open my eyes to the GLORRY THAT IS DUNGEON CRAWLING! Spoiler... it didn't.

Anyway, here it is. It was fun to write and fun to play... I hope others find it enjoyable.
