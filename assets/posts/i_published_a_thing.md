I didn't set out to write a system... I swear. It just _happened_.

Here's how it goes:
1. run a oneshot to play around with [World of Dungeons](http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf)
2. the players; the system; the characters... they all click and it's fun
3. a campaign begins!
4. during your campaign, start hacking bits of the system to the tastes of yourself and your players
<break>
5. players don't like the magic system? [write your own](/#post?s=a_magic_system)
6. hack even more stuff in the second year of your campaign
7. struggle to explain all the hacks to new players
8. write it all down
9. fine... I'll publish it ðŸ™„

**NOTE:** _there's no `10. profit`


Personally, I wish people would publish fewer systems and publish more adventures. But here I am.... publishing a system. But it's funny with systems: they're _personal_. **Finding a system that suits your style and hacking off the bits that get in the way should be second nature to a GM**. Continue hacking to the point where it requires a new telling of the rules? Congratulations! You're now a publisher.

I _do_ plan on writing & publishing adventures. Time will tell what other little distractions I'll encounter along the way.

Stay tuned...
