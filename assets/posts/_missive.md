Missive to the Northern Kings,

The cycle turns again, and still this dread mist hangs like a shroud upon the Sorrow Mountains, befitting the grim task you've charged me with overseeing. Rest assured, my wardens remain vigilant against the most vile and unrepentant souls incarcerated within these walls.

Though the ethereal wards of Yagul Fane's magi hold firm, I grow concerned over the depraved utterings of that wretched hag Kalg. I've requested her confinement be... refortified until her madness passes.

As for the druid filth sequestered in their grove, they remain placid for now - no doubt consumed with plotting their inevitable betrayal as is their wicked nature. You were wise to rip these lands from their greedy grasps and let justice be delivered upon those who dared raise arms against your rightful rule. I'll not allow this lingering root near our Prison to take insidious hold again.

Our supplies hold sufficient for the moment, though increased rations would be welcomed to fortify my wardens against the hardships of their posts in this dismal place. Eternal gloom makes a hell of even simple tasks.

I vow to honor the principles of order, statute and fealty instilled by your virtuous guidance. No matter the depths we must plumb, your law shall be upheld here.

Your Obedient Servant,
Warden Thorvald Cloudcroft
Prison of Mon
