I love me some random generators but mine were showing my neglect and kinda all over the place. My friend [Wightbred](https://wightbred.itch.io/) turned me onto [GM's Apprentice Cards](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/125685/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Base-Deck), which inspired me to refactor and extend my own generators into a single web app. Thus, [Rando](https://rando.brine.dev) was born.

Thanks to feedback from Wightbred and others, I've been able to turn Rando into a surprisingly useful tool. I was able to incorporate all the things I use for my games. I now find myself using it for everything: prep, GM & Player prompts and even prompts to feed ChatGPT. And while I do not _solo [new verb]_ myself, I am told that it works well for Solo Play too.

Give it a spin!
