_v1.1_

Hexcrawls are awesome! They changed my game forever. But I found existing rules complex and/or included needless abstraction. Thus, I wrote my own. I also [published a pdf](https://casadeocio.itch.io/hexcrawls-rule)

### PROCEEDURES

#### Morning

1. Roll weather
1. Consume food/water
1. Break or sustain camp
1. Choose a travel direction and pace
1. Roll navigation

#### Day

1. GM describes points of interest (POIs)/changing weather/terrain/landmarks...
1. Roll random encounters once per hex
1. Roll navigation on direction change
1. Exploring or hunting takes 1/2 day travel time
1. Foraging can be done en route when not on roads but requires a slowed pace

#### Night

1. Make camp
1. Consume food/water
1. Stand watch
1. Roll encounter


### TRAVEL

Hexes are 6 miles. PCs can travel 3 hexes per day at a normal pace; 4 if moving quickly or mounted. Mountains or swamps slow the party to 1 hex per day. Pushing further risks fatigue.

| Type                    | Distance/Time   |
| :----                   |:---             |
| Mapping                 | 1/2 hex per day |
| Hunting                 | 1/2 day         |
| Exploring               | 1/2 day         |
| Travel swamp/mountains  | 1 hex per day   |
| Travel normal           | 3 hexes per day |
| Travel forced/mounted   | 4 hexes per day |

<break>

#### Weather

Roll 2d6: the leftmost die is type of weather, the other severity.

| Weather             | Severity  |
| :----               |:---       |
| 1. Rain/fog/snow    | 1. Epic   |
| 2. Storm            | 2. Severe |
| 3. Wind             | 3. Harsh  |
| 4. Unusual Hot/cold | 4. Moderate|
| 5. Cloudy           | 5. Mild  |
| 6. Clear            | 6. Pleasant |


#### Navigation

Skip navigation rolls when following a road/river/compass/spell/landmark on clear day.

| D6    | Effect|
| :---- |:---   |
| 1     | Loop back to point of departure           |
| 2-3   | Veer one sextant left of intended destination |
| 4-5   | Veer one sextant right of intended destination|
| 6     | Arrive at intended destination            |


#### Discovery

PCs discover POIs in the sextants they traverse. Eg. if the party is traveling NW through a hex and there's a POI in sextants 2 or 5, they should discover it.

<pre>
    _6_
  5/   \1
  4\___/2
     3
</pre>

POIs might also be discovered if the PCs:

- See smoke/light/landmark
- Hear noises
- Smell something
- Observe evidence of it
- Explore the sextant

> PCs can see 3 miles of flat terrain and 1 hex per 50' of elevation (tree/hill/cliff)

#### Fatigue

PCs risk fatigue from lack sleep/food/water, forced travel, heavy burden, miserable conditions or injury. Consuming food/water and resting a day in comfort and safety cures fatigue.

| Level | Effect                    |
| :---- |:---                       |
| 1     | Disadvantaged skill rolls |
| 2     | Speed halved              |
| 3     | Disadvantaged attacks     |
| 4     | Drop all bulky items      |
| 5     | Speed = 0                 |
| 6     | Death                     |


### TIPS

1. Everything's a dungeon... including the wilderness. Anything you'd put in a dungeon can be adapted for the wilderness.
1. Less is more. If a rule isn't fun, ditch it.
1. have 2-3 POIs per hex and some _roving_ POIs (ie. encounters) to call upon. Eg. a traveler; a caravan; a knight on a quest; a messenger; the sisters of the bountiful earth foraging for morrells...
1. POIs should offer _choices and opportunities_. Eg. a stronghold of 40 fighters might: be joined; leveraged into finding a McGuffin; fight for sport; rise up against a common enemy; fight the PCs...
1. The world is your obstacle. The bridge is washed out; the road just ends; this forest is cursed; so many rivers to cross...
1. Offer roses for the PCs to smell. POIs should include wondrous things. Eg. a field of all 4 leaf clovers; a tree with hundreds of ribbons tied to it, each with a wish...
1. Telegraph threats and/or leave their traces. Eg. enemy scouts; a storm; displaced animals/people; hundreds of odd footprints...
1. Is there something hunting/tracking the PCs?
