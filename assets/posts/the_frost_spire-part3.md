description: While ascending the Frost Spire, the crew come upon a ~~roadblock~~ knight in non-shining armor. As Wrath would tell you, returning from the dead is easy compared to climbing an ice tower in full plate. But the crew ties a rope around him and schleps him along (lest be stuck waiting for his slow-ass). Revenants--come to find out--like throwing rocks and hitting things... who knew :shrug:

**The Frost Spire**

Long ago, when the world was new an elf king was banished and tossed into the sea. His hatred was so great, and so cold, that it froze the water into a spire of ice and he was cursed to drift forever, bringing winter to the world.

_But sometimes, he hungers for the blood of bad children..._
