### LOCATIONS

**Freemoon Forest** (aka Fae Forest) stretches westward along the coast and is renowned for its natural allure and enchantment. Mortals avoid these Fae lands when possible, and those who must are wise to hire a fae guide. Near the Prison of Mon, sections of the forest have been ravaged by fire. Speculation of a dragon is rampant, though no confirmed sightings as yet.

**0209 Greever's Lighthouse**

![thumb](/assets/images/southern_coast/prison_of_mon.webp)

**0305 Prison of Mon** is nestled within the craggy embrace of the Sorrow Mountains. It is a grim and foreboding place that reflects its inhabitants. Its architecture was designed to blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings, giving it an almost fortress-like appearance. Within its walls, a series of dark, damp, and windowless cells; each lit by a single torch. Prisoners wear a stone rune from a chain that binds them for the length of their sentence. It _is_ possible for another to take on this burden. Prisoners that die during their sentence become Jailers.

The Jailers stand at attention in the prisons long entrance. Their runes' flickering amber glow the only light. Jailers are attuned to truth and transparency; any attempt to hide one's true nature, intentions, or possessions triggers a reaction.

- Warden Cloudcroft - stern, respected
- Captain Kell - veteran, strict, proud
- Jailers - ethereal guards that wear a stone rune; they form a astral prison with their touch
- Gavric the Silent - Inmate, Dangerous
- Kalg the Silent - Hag, Inmate - rumors of her whispering to a dragon-shaped shadow


**0412 Isle of Wights** wrecked ship; bushes with white berries like yogurt covered raisins, which if eaten within an hour of picking provide full health, later is poison. Dead birds litter the ground; all with berries in their mouths. Dying turns you into a wight?


**0608 Yagul Fane**, two towers constructed by legendary mages Yagul and Fane, stand east of the Twilight Sands. They attract scholars and aspiring magi seeking to study the sands' unique properties.

**1108 Fellstead Monastery** is perched upon the coast, and surrounded by lush, rolling hills, and Starwood forest to the south. The monastery is constructed from warm, honey-colored stone and Gothic architecture. Its walls are adorned with intricate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of St. Fellstead. It is a place of peace and reflection, where people from all walks of life come to seek answers, find comfort, and renew their spirits.

**1405 Loggers Camp** in the heart of Starwood Forest; a stark contrast to the natural beauty that surrounds it. The camp is a rough collection of tents and wooden structures.

In the heart of the farm, a quaint stone cottage stands as the hub of activity, its chimney billowing fragrant smoke from the hearth where mead is brewed in large copper cauldrons. Bees buzz lazily among the blossoms, their diligent work ensuring a plentiful harvest of honey, while workers scurry about, gathering ingredients and preparing barrels for the fermentation process. Amidst the tranquility of the countryside, the meadery farm hums with the rhythmic pulse of nature and the bustling energy of artisanal craftsmanship.


### BESTIERY

**Dune Crawler** is a fearsome creature native to the shifting sands of desert environments like the Twilight Sands. It resembles a monstrous arachnid, with a massive, segmented body covered in tough, chitinous plates. Its long, sinuous legs allow it to move swiftly across the dunes, while its sharp claws and mandibles make short work of prey. The dune crawler's eyes gleam with a predatory intelligence, and its keen senses enable it to detect even the slightest movement in the sand. Its thick exoskeleton provides protection from both the harsh elements of the desert and potential attackers. These formidable predators often lair beneath the sand, emerging to ambush unsuspecting travelers or to defend their territory from intruders.

**Shadow Dragon** becomes flesh when breathing fire or at twilight in the Sands.
