**The Southern Coast** boasts a temperate climate accentuated by gentle sea breezes and occasional coastal fog. Passage to the northern kingdoms is best by sea; avoiding the formidable barriers of the Sorrow Mountains and the West Marshes.

Originally, the region served as a sanctuary for druids. However, the Northern Kings, seeking a remote location to house their most dangerous criminals, commissioned the construction of a prison--or as they put it, a place to "throw our trash". Recognizing the need for magical restraints, they enlisted the expertise of renowned magi Naz Yagul and Uma Fane. Additionally, missionaries were funded to provide support for the prison's operation and potentially convert the remaining druids.

With these pillars of civilization established, the Southern Coast has begun to attract adventurous individuals seeking to make it their home.


### WHAT IS THIS?

The Southern Coast is a system neutral, regional setting designed for sandbox exploration and adventure. It is intended to be serviceable as-is while providing just enough flavor to spark a GM's imagination. GMs are encouraged to customize the content to accommodate their table.

### NEEDS

- stolen fae trinket SOMEWHERE (maybe multiple)
- pass to ensure who/what/when/why/how
- pass to remove shit that isn't directly about the adventure
- pass to connect hexes/factions/npcs
- show don't tell
- TREASURE
- add treasure that kills plants
- dragon vines
- there's a wrecked pirate ship off the coast but it contained only minimal loot. The fisherman stole the loot and burried it under his driftwood shack. He doesn't know what to do with it. If he spends it everyone will know something's up. He loves to fish and this is his home. He makes annonymous VERY charatable contributions to the monestery

Chatty wants this...
- More depth to the factions and their interactions, including their goals, conflicts, and alliances.
- Detailed backgrounds for key NPCs, giving them unique personalities and motivations.
- Additional lore and history for the setting, providing context for the current events and conflicts.

### LOCATIONS

**Freemoon Forest** stretches westward along the South Sea. Wildflowers scent the air and the wind resonates like a familiar melody. Mortals avoid this "Fae Land" whenever possible; those who cannot are wise to hire a guide to help with any Fae "curiosities".

Swaths of forest are being ravaged by fire, leaving the haunting beauty of a charred landscape. A dragon? But no confirmed sightings... yet.

### HEXES

**0104 Shadow Dragon Lair** entrance is obscured by shifting shadows created by bioluminescent fungi, which also provide dim illumination throughout the cave. The shadows are nearly indistinguishable from the dragon itself.

**0209 Greever's Lighthouse** stands weather-beaten, like a skeletal finger pointing to the heavens. Constructed by Ned Greever, whose wife, Ida, met her end by jumping to the cliffs below. Since then, the abandoned lighthouse draws "grievers" who choose a similar fate. All who enter feel a heavy, chilling presence and a lingering sorrow. At the edge of the cliffs is a huge bouquet of purple bog orchids, with a card that reads "My dearest Ida, Your favorite color. Love, PW".

**0302 Lost Druid's Grove** lies nestled amidst the craggy embrace of the Sorrow Mountains. Weathered stone circles tell of countless ceremonies. The Lost Druid herself is currently a prisoner in the Prison of Mon. Her remaining 13 followers perform a sacred daily ceremony. Strangers are tolerated in the grove but NOT at the ceremony.

**0305 Prison of Mon**, carved into craggy face of the Sorrow Mountains, is a grim and foreboding place that reflects its inhabitants. Its architecture was designed to blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings, giving it an almost fortress-like appearance. Within its walls, a series of dark, damp, and windowless cells; each lit by a single torch. Prisoners wear a stone rune from a chain that binds them for the length of their sentence. Prisoners that die during their sentence become Jailers.

The Jailers stand at attention in the prisons long entrance. Their runes' flickering amber glow the only light. Jailers are attuned to truth and transparency; any attempt to hide one's true nature, intentions, or possessions triggers a reaction.

Fellstead Monastery provides a monk (on rotation), food, wine and healthcare for the prisoners. Yagul Fane provides magical protections and the runes that bind prisoners to their sentences. Both of these institutions receive _royal endowments_ from the northern kings. There is a 1 in 6 chance that representatives from either or both are currently

- **Warden Cloudcroft** Stern, Respected - Abbes Salvora visits often and a select few know they are "friendly"
- **Captain Kell** veteran, strict, proud
- **Jailers** ethereal guards that wear a stone rune; can form a painful astral prison with their touch
- **Gavric the Silent** Inmate, Assassin
- **The Hag Kalg** Inmate - rumors of her whispering to a dragon-shaped shadow
- **The Lost Druid** Inmate - her incarceration was a necessary sacrifice to complete a complex ritual
- 18 staff: 12 workers; 6 guards

**0310 The Bone Cairn** is a puzzling landmark. A massive pile of bones arranged in the form of a cairn. If the bones are toppled, they inexplicably restack themselves at twilight, defying explanation.

**0408.1 The Mirage Merchant** A caravan camped near the Twilight Sands; A merchant sells trinkets that magical effects in twilight. 1 in 6 is _actually_ magical.

**0412 Isle of Wights** wrecked ship; bushes with white berries like yogurt covered raisins, which if eaten within an hour of picking provide full health, later is poison. Dead birds litter the ground; all with berries in their mouths. Dying turns you into a wight?

**0502 Shaman** Tulver was a young navigator on the ship now wrecked in #1508. As he washed ashore, he was technically dead for 9 minutes. He awoke a changed man and now refers to himself "The River". He sought out the druids but broke with them to start his own flock... a _new_ sort of Navigator. He's a bit of a sensation and have 42 followers; 17 are true believers that will fight to the death for him.

  d6 | He says shit like
:---:|:--------------------
 1   | "I've navigated the treacherous currents of fate. Call me 'The River' I flow with the wisdom of the ages."
 2   | "Feel my current, my power, swirling like a mighty river. I will chart your course."
 3   | "I'm the compass, guiding you through life's stormy waters."
 4   | "Aye, I once sailed the physical seas, but now I navigate the ethereal waters of the unknown."
 5   | "You don't want to know what lurks in those murky depths."
 6   | "As the ebb and flow command."

**0607 Runes in the Dunes** is a phenomenon that occurs at twilight. As the first light breaks over the horizon, intricate patterns like ancient runes emerge in the shifting sands; as if etched by an unseen hand. These patterns vary in complexity and design, appearing and disappearing with the rhythm of the sunrise. Locals believe these runes hold secrets or messages from the spirits of the desert. Others see them as a natural wonder, a testament to the enigma of the dunes. Regardless, witnessing the Runes in the Dunes is a captivating experience, drawing travelers and curious onlookers alike to behold the artistry of the desert dawn.

**0608 Yagul Fane** is marked by two towering stone towers erected by legendary magi, Naz Yagul and Uma Fane. Governed by The Council of Six, with the head of Fellstead Monastery as tie-breaker when needed. Access beyond the ground floors is limited to magi and staff, and protected by protective wards and spells. Residents are renowned for their mastery of magical disciplines, attracting scholars and adventurers far and wide.

Surrounding the towers is a desert village housing approximately 300 inhabitants. These resilient individuals thrive in the harsh environment, relying on traditional values, adaptability, and self-reliance. Most live in tents; some in permanent stone structures, showcasing their connection to the land.

In the center of the village sits a magical cistern, created by the magi of Yagul Fane, ensuring water for all. This enchanted well symbolizes the community's unity and strength. The villagers engage in herding livestock and participating in trade as part of their daily activities.

**0807.6 Barrow of the Cane**
A 12' rune stone carved into a silver speckled, rust-colored stone. It sets upon a small hill marked with rusty grass. The rune tells an elaborate history of **The Cane**, an ancient tribe of warriors. The barrow has an entrance at its base, framed by monolith stones. The walls within are covered in chalky paintings of men with long spears fighting various monsters; hand prints of men, women and children; and giants in the mountains. The paintings depict families with heads in the shape of various animal spirits. Each cubbyhole is marked with the same various animals.

Cubbyholes contain mostly bones but also: obsidian arrowheads, an obsidian axe, a solid silver bear-like idol (400s) and simple silver jewelry (120s). There are a number of extremely high quality spear poles; one still with a razor-sharp obsidian tip. Resting in this sacred space aids healing.

If the bones are disturbed a ghost will appear. **Zamma** was the tribe's last shaman. His bones are buried beneath the monolith; just above the ceiling of the main chamber. He cannot speak but will point at various drawings on the walls. He will disappear if the bones are returned to their resting place. Taking anything but the weapons (weapons are to use; treasure is property of the Cane) from the barrow (without trade or sacrifice) curses the thief: their fingers > hand > arm > etc start turning red. When they are completely red the thief dies.

**0904 Harlan's Grove** is renowned for producing the region's finest hops, coveted by brewers for their unparalleled quality. Francis and Catherine Harlan have become quite famous to those in the trade. However, the true secret behind the exceptional hops lies in the soil's rare mineral deposit, discovered by the Harlans generations ago. This mineral imbues the hops with distinctive flavors and aromas, making them highly sought after. Guarding their knowledge closely, the Harlans perpetuate the myth of their unparalleled skill, ensuring their dominance in the hop market.

**1004 Maude's Meadery** Vibrant wildflowers bordered by a meandering stream. the meadery farm presents a picturesque scene straight out of a pastoral painting. The air is perfumed with the sweet aroma of honey, mingling with the earthy scent of the surrounding fields. Rows upon rows of lush, golden-hued honeycombs glisten under the gentle sunlight, tended to by diligent beekeepers clad in weathered leather aprons. In the heart of the farm, a quaint stone cottage stands as the hub of activity, its chimney billowing fragrant smoke from the hearth where mead is brewed in large copper cauldrons. Bees buzz lazily among the blossoms, their diligent work ensuring a plentiful harvest of honey, while workers scurry about, gathering ingredients and preparing barrels for the fermentation process. Amidst the tranquility of the countryside, the meadery farm hums with the rhythmic pulse of nature and the bustling energy of artisanal craftsmanship.


**1108 Fellstead Monastery** is perched upon the edge of the coast and surrounded by lush, rolling hills. The monastery is constructed from warm, honey-colored stone and Gothic architecture. Its walls are adorned with intricate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of St. Fellstead (patron saint of travelers and seekers of knowledge). It is a place of peace and reflection, where people from all walks of life come to seek answers, find comfort, and renew their spirits.

The Monastery boasts a renowned library, a trip of goats that produces fine milk/cheese and a rather fabulous winery.

**1405 Loggers Camp** in the heart of Starwood Forest; a stark contrast to the natural beauty that surrounds it. The camp is a rough collection of tents and wooden structures. The sounds of axes and saws echo through the trees. The loggers harvest the valuable timber while grappling with their impact on the ancient woodland.

- Foreman "Boss" Bartok - burly, caring (crew and sustainability of logging)
- Lena "Sawbones" Thorne - Medic, Herbalist, Gentle
- Lucia "Twig" Thorne - Camp Mom, Agile, Cheerful

**1408 Fishing Hamlet** Of it's handful of huts, the one closest to the sea belongs to **Pesh**, a fourth-generation fisherman. Buried beneath his hut lies a chest containing 10,000 silver coins salvaged from the shipwreck off the coast. It took him seven trips under the cover of night to retrieve the treasure. Now burdened with the fear of attracting bandits if he spends the wealth, Pesh refuses to leave his home. Instead, he makes anonymous donations to the monastery and invests in a slightly nicer boat, hoping to secure his future without drawing unwanted attention to his newfound fortune.


**1506 Boat Hut** A large overturned boat repurposed into a makeshift dwelling. Remnants of its former life as a vessel are evident in the hull's curvature and the weathered planks. Within this curious abode resides a reclusive witch. She is known for her extensive knowledge of herbal remedies and potions, which she brews using ingredients gathered from the surrounding marshlands and forests. She is rumored to possess mystical powers, particularly in the realms of divination and curses, although few dare to seek her out for fear of her unpredictable nature.

**1508 Pirate Shipwreck** lies just off the coast, its remains jutting from the water. Barnacles cling to its splintered boards, broken masts, and rusting cannons. A haunting reminder of the sea's perils, promising hidden treasures to brave explorers. Carved onto a board just above the waterline is "Pesh was here" [hex 1405].

**1603 Old Pete's Boggery** is a peat farm and a labyrinth of treacherous pathways and hidden perils. Quicksand pits lie in wait to ensnare the unwary, while giant leeches slither through the muck. Rare herbs and exotic flora thrive in the damp, fertile soil, coveted by herbalists and alchemists alike. Lost treasures lie buried beneath the layers of peat, waiting to be discovered by intrepid adventurers willing to brave the dangers of the bog.

**1603 West Marshes** sprawl endlessly; a labyrinth of murky waters and treacherous bogs. The scent of damp earth and rotting vegetation choke the air. Amidst this daunting landscape, Pete West's peat farm stands as a testament to human resilience. With his daughter Gowain and a dedicated team of 12 hands, Pete toils tirelessly to extract valuable peat from the marshes. Despite the challenges posed by the terrain, the farm not only sustains itself but also provides a crucial resource for the surrounding communities.


### HEXTRAS

The following hex/encounters can be used as random situations throughout the Southern Coast as the GM requires.

1. **Shadow Walker** A robed woman sits cross legged in the sand. She's waiting for the sun to either come out or be at the right moment so she can shadowalk to a specific place. Without the sun, there is no shadow; at the right time, she will walk into a shadow, through a disorienting maze of darkeness and out of another shadow that she has seen and knows the angle of at specific moments. Shadow walking is tricky; the traveler may come out feet or miles off course. The woman might teach PCs how it works for a price.

2. **Classic Traveler** A rather tall man walks with a limp next to an empty two-cart train pulled by two large oxen. He will introduce himself as **Malfas**. Malfas is an alien in human form and a few hundred years early to play basketball. The oxen are mechanical which only cutting them would reveal. Only their crazy strength would be telling that they are not real oxen. Their names are Jake and Jim. The traveler has 5 marbles that can perform what some would call miracles. He used one to make Jake, Jim and the cart. He needs one to return home. He's looking for work but really wants to study humans.

3. **Mad Monk** is dressed in pink robes of an improbable shade of bright pink. His eyes dart with a manic glint, and he mumbles to himself incoherently. He's out of water and will ask the PCs if they can spare any. He's quite mad... he's looking for a door. He might remember his name is **Jaeral**.

4. **Four Leaf Clover Field** A field of ONLY four leaf clovers... finding a THREE leaf clover brings the bearer LUCK.

5. **Aware Wolf** Buzzards circle overhead 100 yards off. The target is a goat carcass that looks to have been mostly devoured by wolves. A werewolf in human form sleeps soundly in a nearby thicket. Slender with dark curly hair and covered in blood; his name is **Zander**. He will try to avoid notice and pretend to be looking for a lost dog if noticed. Zander and his pack only pose a threat at night. He speaks to a dead friend...

6. **Fare Fight** A copper-skinned warrior named **Lunara** (Warrior, Proud) is fighting three armored traders; her broken spear lodged in one trader's shoulder, she now wields daggers. The trader's wagon is smoking and will soon go up in flames. Within the wagon are 300s of pelts and two casks of fine wine (200s). _Wandering hands_ were NOT part of the fare.

The dune crawler's eyes gleam with a predatory intelligence, and its keen senses enable it to detect even the slightest movement in the sand. Its thick exoskeleton provides protection from both the harsh elements of the desert and potential attackers. These formidable predators often lair beneath the sand, emerging to ambush unsuspecting travelers or to defend their territory from intruders.
