**A Loggers Camp** in the heart of Starwood Forest; a stark contrast to the natural beauty that surrounds it. The camp is a rough collection of tents and wooden structures.

**Prison of Mon** is nestled within the craggy embrace of the Sorrow Mountains. It is a grim and foreboding place that reflects its inhabitants. Its architecture was designed to blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings, giving it an almost fortress-like appearance. Within its walls, a series of dark, damp, and windowless cells; each lit by a single torch. Prisoners wear a stone rune from a chain that binds them for the length of their sentence. It _is_ possible for another to take on this burden. Prisoners that die during their sentence become Jailers.

The Jailers stand at attention in the prisons long entrance. Their runes' flickering amber glow the only light. Jailers are attuned to truth and transparency; any attempt to hide one's true nature, intentions, or possessions triggers a reaction.

- Captain Kell - veteran, strict, proud
- Jailers - ethereal guards that wear a stone rune; they form a astral prison with their touch

**Duskby** is situated in a sheltered valley, surrounded by rolling hills and woodlands.

xxxx Barrow of the Cane | Wonder
A 12' rune stone carved into a silver speckled, rust-colored stone. It sets upon a small hill marked with rusty grass. The rune tells an elaborate history of **The Cane**; an ancient tribe of warriors. The barrow has an entrance at its base, framed by monolith stones. The walls within are covered in chalky paintings of men with long spears fighting various monsters; hand prints of men, women and children; and giants in the mountains. The paintings depict families with heads in the shape of various animal spirits. Each cubbyhole is marked with the same various animals.

Cubbyholes contain mostly bones but also: obsidian arrowheads and an obsidian axe; a solid silver bear-like idol (400s); simple silver jewelry (120s). There are a number of extremely high quality spear poles; one still with a razor-sharp obsidian tip. Resting in this spiritual place aids healing.

If the bones are disturbed a ghost will appear. **Zamma** was the tribe's last shaman. His bones are buried beneath the monolith; just above the ceiling of the main chamber. He cannot speak but will point at various drawings on the walls. He will disappear if the bones are returned to their resting place.
