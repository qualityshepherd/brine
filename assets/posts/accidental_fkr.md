My game has been unintentionally _molting_ toward **FKR**. It started before ever hearing the term. It just kinda happened and I continue to enjoy its inherent permission for further mutations.

During a hiatus from D&D 5E, I found myself reading other game systems; exploring their rules (or lack thereof) and ideas. Honestly, I hadn't put together that I wanted to run another system. I was just being curious. Bits and pieces of various systems started to click; most notably, [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com).

Hilariously, I've never run Dungeon World; nor do I have interest in doing so. I don't find it to be a particularly compelling game, but rather a fantastic GM reference! Just reading it changed the way I run games. It also illuminated my want of a different ruleset: something simpler; more inclusive. I didn't need to look very far (even if I did)... DW lead me right to [World of Dungeons (WoDu)](https://johnharper.itch.io/world-of-dungeons).

There are a number of things in WoDu that changed my game forever (`2d6` & `Die of Fate` come to mind) but in terms of FKR, it was _the holes_. _What do these Skills do? How do rituals work? Decipher?_ The old GM in me would have thought: _"okay, I need to figure out all this shit before we play"_. But thanks to my exploration of other rulesets, I was able to give myself permission to put these questions to _my group_. My players really took to this inclusive approach to rule creation. It's very likely why we've been playing for so long (going on 3 years)! Lighter rules also lead to less character sheet-gazing and more creativity. I was hooked!

Two years later, I published some of these _house rules_ as [Beasts & Barrows](https://casadeocio.itch.io/beasts-barrows). But shortly thereafter, even BnB started feeling heavy to me. So with an inspiring nudge from [2400](https://jasontocci.itch.io/2400), I took another step and revamped them into their new, unfinished form: [1420 Beasts & Barrows](https://casadeocio.itch.io/1420-bnb). The most notable differences being the lack of stats and d6 dice pool skills. This new ruleset is currently peculating with my regular crew.

For the record, I have no desire to debate what is/isn't FKR. I am not an authority; nor do I wish to be. I purposely refrained from explaining it or linking it to anything here. I prefer its definition to remain elusive and open. I find my game jives with the idea of FKR more than other rpg philosophies (for lack of a better term). YMMV.
