When writing my [magic system](#post?s=a_magic_system) for [Beasts & Barrows](https://casadeocio.itch.io/beasts-barrows), I had two goals: keep it simple and _somewhat_ logical. Towards simplicity, I reused the existing game mechanics: `2d6`, `attributes` and `level`. I also considered using Necropraxis' fabulous [spell dice](https://www.necropraxis.com/2013/11/01/spell-dice) but simplicity won out.

Making the system logical took a lot more thought.

Several people describe my magic system as _Vancian_ (ie. spells must be prepared daily; have a fixed purpose and finite usage). **I did not set out to make my system specifically _non-Vancian_**. This is good because when I think about it, it really is quite Vancian... but with _twists._

<break>

First twist: preparation. It's silly to expect magi to prepare spells every day. It _does_ make sense that spells are learned, practiced and _mastered_. We see this in Harry Potter; the kids all practicing enunciation and wand flicking. But this leans more toward _practice_ than preparation. It's also logical that magi have a limited number of spells they've _mastered_. This number increases as their experience increases. **I want players thinking of creative ways to use the spells they have**.

_Spellbooks_. What dolt-of-a-mage cannot memorize a few spells? Must they write them all down in a book? If they're without that book, can they no longer cast a spell? Lame. No. But books _are_ quite useful. **Magi can read and cast _unfamiliar_ spells from scrolls and books**, but it takes more time (a turn). It also incentivizes _scroll hunts_. Fun!

Which leads us to usage. It's ridiculous that a mage would forget a spell after casting it. Same goes for it vanishing from their spellbook. No. That's crazytown. The twist here is that casting spells takes a physical toll. A mage can safely cast spells, based on their stamina (`con`), and have it scale with their experience (`hd`). This could have also been level but I feel like `hd` is a bit closer to health... same diff. **Cast all the spells you want... but it will eventually hurt**.

Lastly, we have _spells with a fixed purpose_. Spell authors will have a lot to say about this. But a few twists can keep them simple and allow for more creative usage. I love **levelless spells**. I can see an argument that spell level denotes complexity or whatever... but I prefer to let a mage learn whatever spell they like. I also added [enhancement spells](#spellTags?t=enhancement). Spells that enhance a target spell but cost an extra spell slot. This helps keep spells simple and flexible.
