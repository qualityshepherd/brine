_v 1.3_

In [World of Dungeons](http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf), `Skills and Special Abilities` help define a character's class. They map directly to the classic classes: **Cleric, Fighter, Mage, Ranger & Thief**; but they can also be bent to accommodate custom classes... like [Alchemist](assets/images/chars/benedict_sandaries.pdf) or [Road Agent](assets/images/chars/black_jenny.pdf). The following details how these rules have evolved in my games.

### Skills
> When a PC attempts something in the fiction that might be covered by a skill (eg. Athletics when climbing) they can roll _advantage_ (`3d6` & keep the highest 2) `+ mod` instead of a regular roll.

- **Athletics:** `+str/dex`: feats of strength and dexterity
- **Awareness:** `+wis`: perceiving the environment around you
- **Deception:** `+cha`: attempt to deceive
- **Decipher:** `+wis`: discern a thing; attempt to understand or interpret
- **Heal:** `+wis`: provide an extra `hd` to the party when resting/rolling `hp`; heal `1d6+level hp` with your touch.
- **Leadership:** `+cha`: use leverage to influence someone; diplomacy; intimidate; parley
- **Lore:** `+int`: consult your accumulated knowledge about something
- **Stealth:** `+dex`: attempt to be sneaky
- **Survival:** `+con`: foraging, hunting; start a fire in unfavorable conditions, etc


### Special Abilities
> These abilities can add additional flavor to a class. The word `attempt` will generally signify rolling a `2d6+mod` when applicable.

- **Backstab:** +3 damage from concealment
- **Bless:** anoint items with holy water for +/-3 damage and as magical
- **[Cantrips](https://brine.dev/#spellTags?t=cantrip):** cast 3 simple magical spells
- **Command:** attempt to command any spirit, demon, etc.
- **Cure:** attempt to neutralize poisons or remove curses
- **Hardy:** +6 hp
- **Lucky:** turn a miss into a partial success once per day
- **Pet:** you have a loyal and _effective_ animal companion
- **Reflexes:** you always act first and cannot be surprised
- **Ritual:** attempt occult rituals; detailed in ancient tomes and scrolls
- **Scout:** with you on point, your party can move quicker, cover more ground and spot targets before they spot you
- **Skirmish:** +1 damage; worn armor counts as one type lighter
- **Slay:** +2 melee damage
- **Summon:** summon a spirit you know by its true name
- **Tinker:** pick a lock, pocket or trap w/ tools
- **Tough:** +1 armor
- **Turn:** attempt to hold undead at bay with your faith and holy symbol
- **Vision:** commune with your deity or demon via holy water/drugs
- **Volley:** +2 ranged damage
- **Wild:** converse with and attempt to command animals; some classes (eg. Druids) use this to _shapeshift_
