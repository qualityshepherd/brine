We are exploring different approaches to TTRPGs. Through play we have come to value:

- A shared understanding of a world over rules
- Table trust over systems
- Immersion over character sheets
- Conversation and negotiation over procedures

That is, while there is value in the elements on the right, we value the elements on the left more.
