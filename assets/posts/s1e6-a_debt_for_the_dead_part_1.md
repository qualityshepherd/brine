![thumb](assets/images/season1_thumb.png)The crew fly through a stitch in time and find themselves... well... dead... _again_. We are also introduced to delicious _Breakfast Donuts_!

This is a one-ish shot that I wrote for the [2020 One Page Dungeon Contest](https://www.dungeoncontest.com/opdc-2020) and slipped it into our campaign (so sneaky). It's called [a Debt for the Dead](https://brine.dev/#post?s=one_page_dungeon_contest). It turned out to be a ton of fun, and _marked_ the entire campaign FOREVAH! Looking at it today, I can see why it wasn't well received by the judges :) I really hate doing _print work_ and it shows. Still... fun stuff!

**World of Brine** is an _actual play_, rpg, podcast, using the [World of Dungeons (WoDu)](http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf) ruleset.
